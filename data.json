When I was able to see the rings of Saturn with my own eyes from my backyard, I was completely hooked on space!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>How did you end up working in the space program? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I was able to come to JPL as a high school student the night that NASA's Opportunity rover landed as a participant in the Planetary Society&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.planetary.org/explore/projects/redrover/\">Red Rover Goes to Mars</a> student astronaut program.  Being in the room with a bunch of scientists when Opportunity&rsquo;s first images arrived on Earth inspired me to pursue a specific career path in planetary science.  I stuck to that dream by studying physics and geology as an undergraduate at Yale University, and then went on to grad school at Washington University in St. Louis, where I got a Ph.D. in planetary science working with Professor Ray Arvidson.  Professor Arvidson was the deputy principal investigator of the Opportunity rover and often encourages students to become involved in tactical rover operations in addition to their research.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>After grad school, I went to Caltech for a postdoctoral fellowship to work with another Mars rover team member, Bethany Ehlmann. I then interviewed at JPL, where I was offered a permanent position as a research scientist to continue to study Mars and work on current (and future) Mars missions. </p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=''>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin clearfix'></div>\n<div class='quote'>\n\"My dad brought home a very small telescope when I was in the third grade.

Ms. Moran, Mr. DeGasperis, Ms. Matthews, Mr. Donaldson, Dr. Rock, Mr. Schaefer, Mr. Ostrander, Ms. Dvorsky, Mr. Heidler, Ms. Counihan, Ms. Bishop, Ms. Dyas, Mr. Stein... these are just some of many great teachers I was fortunate to learn from who come to mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I also had three very important mentors while I was in high school &ndash; Emily Lakdawalla at the Planetary Society gave me my very first lessons in planetary science and showed me how awesome a career in this field could be.  Nader Haghighipour and K.E. Saavik Ford were postdocs at the Carnegie Institute in Washington DC (now at University Hawaii-Manao and City University of New York) and mentored me in a research project the summer before my senior year of high school.  They were the first to show me what is was like to have a research career, and I learned so much from them.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What does your job entail? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I spend a lot of my time helping to run the two rovers currently on Mars: Opportunity and Curiosity.  I work with the rest of the science team to select interesting science targets to study and I analyze the results to improve our understanding of the history of Mars.  I also do research using data from Mars orbiters.  When I&rsquo;m not backseat-driving rovers, I write papers, work with students, attend conferences, and write proposals for future research.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career.  </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Becoming deputy project scientist for the Opportunity rover, the same mission that inspired me to become a planetary scientist over 14 years ago.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What are you looking forward to in your career? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>All of the things we will learn about the solar system in the next 30 years!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give someone who wants to take the same career path as you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Don&rsquo;t ever be afraid to ask questions about things that interest you.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I love to travel, cook, and explore all of the wonderful things to do in the city of Los Angeles.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What's your favorite space image? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA05755\">Opportunity's landing panorama of Eagle Crater</a>.

The smooth, dark plains of Meridiani and in-place bedrock exposed in the wall of Eagle crater were extremely different from images of the surface of Mars returned at that time by previous rovers and landers, and this image inspired me to study planetary science.</span></p>\r\n",

After attending R. L. Paschal High School in Fort Worth, Texas, Bean went on to attend the University of Texas where her earned a Bachelor of Science in aeronautical engineering (1955). While at the University of Texas, Bean was a member of the Navy ROTC. Upon graduation, Bean was commissioned, completed flight training and was later assigned to a jet attack squadron in Jacksonville, Fla. After a four-year tour of duty, Bean attended the Navy Test Pilot School, flying as a test pilot on several types of naval aircraft.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In October 1963 Bean was one of the third group of astronauts named by NASA and served as a backup astronaut for the Gemini 10 and Apollo 9 missions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Apollo 12: </b> It was in November 1969, when Bean (lunar module pilot) and Captain Pete Conrad landed in the moon's \"Ocean of Storms\" after a flight of some 250,000 miles. This was the second manned lunar landing. Bean and Conrad explored the lunar surface, deployed several lunar surface experiments and installed the first nuclear power generator station on the moon to provide the power source.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After becoming one of the only 12 men in history to walk on the moon, Bean served NASA in a variety of roles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bean was spacecraft commander of <a href='http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/skylab/' target='_blank'>Skylab</a> Mission II (SL-3) in 1973. As commander on this 59-day, 24,400,000 mile, world-record setting flight, Bean helped to accomplish 150 percent of the mission's pre-mission forecast goals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bean's next assignment for NASA was as a backup spacecraft commander of the United States flight crew for the joint American-Russian <a href='http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/apollo-soyuz/' target='_blank'>Apollo-Soyuz Test Project</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bean retired from the Navy in October 1975. However, he continued as head of the Astronaut Candidate Operations and Training Group within the Astronaut Office at NASA in a civilian capacity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An accomplished artist, Bean retired from NASA in June 1981 to devote his full time to painting. Bean said his decision was based on the fact that, in his 18 years as an astronaut, he was fortunate enough to visit worlds and see sights no artist's eye -- past or present -- has ever viewed firsthand. He is pursuing his dream at his home and studio in Houston, Texas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Awards and Recognitions: </b><br />\r\n*Bean helped to establish 11 world records in space and astronautics<br />\r\n*Two NASA Distinguished Service Medals<br />\r\n*Navy Astronaut Wings<br />\r\n*Two Navy Distinguished Service Medals<br />\r\n*Rear Admiral William S.

He's thrilled to be in the air and back on the hunt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This isn't a combat mission. Alan is a planetary scientist. And while the U.S. Navy's F/A-18 Hornet is a battle-proven fighter jet, NASA's <a href='http://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/home/index.html' target='_blank'>Dryden Flight Research Center</a> converted this warbird into a powerful research tool.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alan and his colleague, Dr. Daniel Durda, used the modified F/A-18 Hornet with a sophisticated camera system called the <a href='http://www.boulder.swri.edu/swuis/swuistor.html' target='_blank'>Southwest Ultraviolet Imaging System</a> (SWUIS) to search for a group of mountain-sized asteroids between the orbit of Mercury and the Sun that are so elusive and hard to see that scientists aren't even sure they exist.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin clearfix'></div>\n<div class='quote'>\n\"With Pluto and the Kuiper Belt, it's wide open. It's like the Wild West. You get to be the first to do things. It has its own romance and excitement in addition to the actual research value.\"\n</div>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin'></div>\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>The F/A-18 jet gave Alan a unique view to search for the giant space rocks called Vulcanoids. The twilight is darker at high altitudes, which allows the camera to capture better images. He's also used the orbiting Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) spacecraft to search for the elusive objects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chasing Vulcanoids was just one exciting chapter in Alan's amazing planetary science career exploring what he calls the Wild West of our solar system -- mysterious, unexplored regions in space that may harbor clues to the origins of our little neighborhood in the Milky Way Galaxy. He loves his work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alan is best known as the principal investigator on New Horizons, the first-ever mission to Pluto and the Kuiper Belt. He has made detailed studies of Neptune's largest moon, Triton. Every now and then his desire to learn something new brings him closer to home to study asteroids or the thin atmosphere of the Earth's Moon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He has been a guest observer on numerous NASA satellite observatories, including the International Ultraviolet Explorer, the Hubble Space Telescope, the International Infrared Observer and the Extreme Ultraviolet Observer.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>How did you get involved in the Vulcanoids program?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I'll never tell! I'm kidding. I've had a long-term interest in aviation and I was a finalist to fly on the Space Shuttle, so I've been around hardware a lot. I've flown instruments for years. When the opportunity presented itself to go for the comet Hale Bopp, we needed a high altitude platform and we were able to show NASA that it was easier to turn the right astronomer into a backseater crewman than it was to turn a professional backseater into a guy who can do all the science.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My institute paid to send me to Pensacola Naval Air Station for the requisite training. And I took some other courses and of course the medical checks and came out the other end qualified to fly on the <a href='http://www.boulder.swri.edu/swuis/wb57.html' target='_blank'>WB-57</a> and then later other aircraft.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What makes you think Vulcanoids are there?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I don't know if they are really there. What I can tell you from experience is that everywhere in the solar system, where there are stable orbital niches -- the asteroid belt, the Kuiper Belt, the Trojan regions of Jupiter, you can go right down the list -- every place there is a stable niche, material is there. So experience would tell us it's a fair bet that there may be some Vulcanoids. But we could be completely wrong. This is a different place. It's much hotter and so only certain materials could persist there. And because it's close to the sun, radiation pressures can actually clean the region out. It is so much more affected than, for example, the asteroid belt; it may be that there are no Vulcanoids. I can't tell you until we finish, but I guarantee if we find them you won't have a hard time hearing about it.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>How did you wind up working on the Pluto mission?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I actually started my career in planetary science with a master's thesis on Pluto.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Why do we need to send a spacecraft to Pluto and the Kuiper Belt?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We're in the space exploration business and the outer solar system is a wild, wooly place. We haven't explored it very well. Pluto and the Kuiper Belt have been just ranked by our once-every-ten-years decadal survey to be the highest priority for exploration in the solar system. That's not by our group, but an independent panel from the National Academy of Sciences. It's No. 1 on the runway for making progress toward understanding the birth of the solar system.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Why is that?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In part, it's because that region of the solar system is much more primitive. It's much more like the formation days. And also because we know so little, we have so much to gain.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>It sounds like you love your job. Is there anything you don't like about your career?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>No one working as an astronomer is shackled in chains. This is a tremendous profession. There are lots of neat people and you get to do cool things. If I had to say something negative, it's that there's often a whole lot of travel that takes me away from my children. That can be a bummer a lot of times.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>When did you know you wanted to be involved in space science?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I would say since I was 7 or 8. I've had this illness a long time ... I just got real excited by the Apollo program and wanted to be part of space exploration.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>How did you decide to focus on the planets of our solar system?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I like the planets because they are real places that you can go to and send machines to. Faraway astronomy -- galactic astronomy and extra-galactic astronomy -- is really cool stuff, but to me it's about destinations. I picked the outer solar system because by the time I was in graduate school all the first explorations of Mars and Venus and Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus were already out of the way and there was no chance to get on board something really groundbreaking. With Pluto and the Kuiper Belt, it's wide open. It's like the Wild West. You get to be the first to do things. It has its own romance and excitement in addition to the actual research value.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What kind of advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Study hard. Whether it's atmospheric science, geology or engineering, whatever it might be -- pick something that you really like to do because the hours are long. Go to the best school and hook up with the best people you can find. But also take some time out to be a well-rounded person.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Are there any people that inspired you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><a href='http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/htmlbios/young.html' target='_blank'>John Young</a>, Dave Scott and <a href='http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a17/a17.crew.html' target='_blank'>Harrison Schmidt</a>, Apollo astronauts, all inspired me. If I had to pick people who really inspired me, it would be those guys and Carl Sagan.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I raise my kids. I have three children. Between work and my kids, I pretty much gave up my other hobbies. I used to fly Cessnas, but I can't talk myself into it anymore. It's pretty hard to get into that Volkswagen once you've driven Mach 1 racers. I like gardening. I like photography. I've written some books and I like writing. But more than anything, I like raising my kids.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I also like my work. And there's way too much exploring to be done for a 40-hour week.</p>\r\n",

We are so close, we were evacuated during the Station Fire of 2009. Because of where we live, I am president of my local Fire Safe Council, and actively raise funds to do brush clearance for our neighborhood.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Describe the first time you made a personal connection with outer space.</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My mother was an armchair space buff and an avid reader, who devoured science fiction and delighted in sci-fi on TV or movies. She loved Buck Rodgers, Jules Verne, Ray Bradbury, Kim Robinson, Harlan Ellison, Arthur C. Clarke, Ursula La Guin and so many more. She had shelves of paperbacks and was a frequent visitor to our library. She shared that love and would take us outside as kids, point to the constellations and start telling us stories of the night sky. To hear of all the stories associated with the constellations brought me to my local library, where I would read about mythology fables from across the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then the Apollo missions happened. Story met reality, and my mother just thought that was magic. She sat in her chair, with tears. \"Never thought I'd see the day.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>How did you end up working in the space program?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My background was actually in finance, then social work coupled with a Master's degree in education with a focus on at risk populations&mdash;so I am the classic case of what not to do! And yet both have served well.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My mother and my husband Randii, who loves space and also works at the <a href='http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/' target='_blank'>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</a> (JPL). When my mom met Randii, the two of them hit it off so well I could have walked out of the room just to let them talk about space, and NASA, and science fiction and on and on. My mother passed in 2007, so I will forever cherish that she always got such a kick out of her son-in-law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course it is only fair to say my mom also taught all six of her kids to fish. To this day, my brothers and I enjoy casting our fishing lures in rivers and watching meteor showers and telling stories. Thanks, Mom.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is a Solar System and Technology Education and Public Outreach Manager?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We consider it our responsibility and an honor to give back to the public and to make a difference with students. We create materials for the public and students to encourage and support them in science and engineering and math. We work with museums, schools, educators and so many more. But if a student wants to be a storyteller, well, that would be wonderful too.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career.</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Too many and more to come. Each mission has its many moments. It is great to share those with the missions I get to work with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My career is only one part of my life. I also work in my community, I volunteer, I am president of my local Fire Safety Council raising funds as a non-profit to do needed brush clearance. Life is so much more than work.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Passion and tenacity, coupled with patience and humor. All will serve you well regardless of what you do.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Fish, fresh water preferred. Read. Movies. Cook with fresh ingredients and local produce. Catch a good meteor shower. Travel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And we love hanging with our teens. My husband and I enjoy our kids and getting silly with them. They crack us up.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Whatever you do be sure you love it. I was not a science, math or engineering graduate, but I love to work with engineers and scientists. My son loves physics, and my daughter likes chemistry, but they also both enjoy plenty of other things. Experiment, try things, work hard, and then follow what you love to do.</p>\r\n",

      "body": "<h3><b>Where are you from? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Due to my father's service with the United Methodist Church, my family moved around a lot when I was a child. We lived in various locations in eastern Tennessee, but my high school was in the Kingsport, Tenn., area. Now I live with my own family in Decatur, Ga.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Describe the first time you made a personal connection with outer space. </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In particular, I remember a night hike at summer camp when I was about 10 years old, where we went to the top of a mountain ridge. The sky was just splendid, with thousands of stars and a breathtaking Milky Way, and I felt a particular thrill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Throughout my childhood, I enjoyed several family trips -- and school field trips -- to the Bay Mountain Park and Planetarium. Aside from the visual enjoyment of the night sky, I also enjoyed viewing space exhibits. When we went to the Smithsonian, I got to touch the Moon rock -- that was amazing to me. Plus walking through the SkyLab and seeing the (rather small!) size of the Apollo capsule was another important experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, probably the most captivating space experience for me from when I was young was the very first launch of the Space Shuttle in 1980. I got up extra early several times that week (as the launch went through a couple of delays) to try to see the launch live. The Space Shuttle launch was even more thrilling than other rocket launches because I knew that it would glide back to Earth to be flown again!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><blockquote>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin clearfix'></div>\n<div class='quote'>\n\"Embrace your inner nerd and seek </span><span>out others who speak your language </span><span>and love the things you love.\"\n</div>\n<footer>\n<cite>- Amy Lovell</cite>\n</footer>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin'></div>\n</blockquote></span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>How did you end up working in the space program? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My first project related to the space program was a summer research experience at Cornell University and the Arecibo Observatory when I was an undergraduate student. That summer I looked at radar images of craters on Venus, in preparation for the Magellan spacecraft's encounter with this planet in 1990.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In graduate school I worked on comets and asteroids. Much of what we've learned about these small objects is based on the images and close-up photography from spacecraft such as Giotto, Galileo, NEAR, Deep Space 1, Deep Impact, Rosetta, Hayabusa, and now Dawn. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>As an observer who uses ground-based telescopes, I have several times been in a position of making support observations to help in mission planning; helping to maximize the scientific return of the mission when it arrives at its destination.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is a Professor of Astronomy? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The daily job of a college professor is never dull. There are the things you would expect a professor to do, for example, teaching classes and guiding students in research. However, there are many other parts of my job description: On campus, I advise students (all levels) in selecting their courses or applying for jobs and fellowships. I select and maintain equipment for teaching laboratories, and serve on committees that take care of the daily business of the college. I also have the opportunity to aid the profession of astronomy by serving as a peer reviewer for funding proposals, NASA missions, telescope time requests, and articles submitted for publication. I have also been a member of review committees and I have been involved in professional political advocacy and education.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career. </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I can't think of one individual moment in my career that is my favorite; however, I do have a category of favorite moments. Astronomers have the privilege of travel, and often to very interesting and remote locations. My favorite moments have been when I'm traveling the world to various observatories on the tops of mountains, to conferences and to meetings in international cities -- I so enjoy what I have learned in these places.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I was inspired by my college professors and summer research mentors, my graduate school professors, postdoctoral mentors, and now by my colleagues the world over. Many times in my education and career path I have been surprised, but pleased, when a senior person in the field (or sometimes a peer) would take a personal interest in my success.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My undergraduate professors, Alberto Sadun and Arthur Bowling at Agnes Scott College were incredibly devoted to the education of their students. At Maria Mitchell Observatory, my mentor Emilia Belserene patiently guided me in my first summer of research and helped me see how much I loved astronomical observations. Don Campbell at Cornell helped me develop interests in radar astronomy (with the help of Alice Hine at Arecibo Observatory), Unix operating systems, advanced computer programming, and dynamics of comets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In graduate school, I enjoyed a lot of opportunities to observe with the Five College Radio Astronomy Observatory (FCRAO), and am indebted to my graduate advisor Peter Schloerb for opportunities, patience and a lot of scientific inspiration. In my postdoctoral position at Amherst College (and the Five College Astronomy Department), I was inspired by George Greenstein and by Darby Dyar for their innovativeness and highly-engaged teaching style.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I've had many other inspirations: in Carl Sagan for his passion for communicating a love of science with everyone; in Sally Ride for focusing on the inspiration of young girls interested in science and space; and in numerous dedicated and devoted colleagues who are able to fit in more than is possible in a \"regular\" work week in order to push the frontiers of science and to inspire the next generation of scientists.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Go for it, but be flexible to see what else comes along the path. There are lots of ways to be a scientist, lots of areas of study and lots of types of professors&mdash;having an open mind about what constitutes a successful career path is really important.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, don't be afraid to let other areas of your life influence your career decisions: Where can you and your partner both have good jobs? What situation will be best if you want to have kids? Do you want to have more time to be with your family? What kind of environment do you prefer to work in? What kind of job will make you feel like you've done something meaningful? Ask questions along the way -- you'll know a situation is a good place to work or study if people are happy to answer your questions and don't judge you by them.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I already mentioned travel, which I dearly love, but just about any nature experience or adventure. I've learned to fly airplanes, to SCUBA dive, to speak Spanish, I've been mountain-climbing, sailing, canoeing, kayaking, rafting, parasailing, skydiving, horseback riding, snorkeling, dogsledding, skiing, zip-lining, tubing, skating, bicycling, and I'm always looking for new adventures. I also enjoy music, going for walks, watching movies, and playing games.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>First, take as much math as you can, and never be afraid to ask for help in mastering new concepts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Second, make yourself part of an amiable group of like-minded friends: embrace your inner nerd and seek out others who speak your language and love the things you love. When you are with friends and feel supported, you can meet larger challenges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thirdly, learn to share what you love in plain language, and describe it for people who ask: People really are interested in technical subjects and are always happy to meet someone who can explain things in an understandable way in order to help increase their interest.<br />\r\n </p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><b>Read More: </b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>*<a href='http://dawn.jpl.nasa.gov/' target='_blank'>Dawn</a><br />\r\n*<a href='http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/deepimpact/main/' target='_blank'>Deep Impact</a><br />\r\n*<a href='http://www.esa.int/esaMI/Rosetta/index.html' target='_blank'>Rosetta</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n",

Since then I have been involved entirely with robotic missions, including studying future missions. My work with the Cassini mission to Saturn led to my current job at NASA's <a href='http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/home/index.html' target='_blank'>Goddard Space Flight Center</a> (GSFC).

Some people are more specific and say it only applies to people who study the Universe, rather than anything in the solar system. Because my work focuses on planetary atmospheres, I consider myself a planetary scientist.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Being the first person to see a particular view of another world is always exciting. Still, probably the best one was when the comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 fragments hit Jupiter in 1994. I was still in graduate school and I was invited to spend the entire week of the impacts at the Space Telescope Science Institute working behind the scenes. The Hubble optics had just been repaired, and we were just blown away by the spectacular images and the marks left by each impact. The teamwork of so many dedicated folks was also amazing, and that has been true for every mission where I've been involved.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Study hard and don't give up, but also look for the opportunities that may lead you down completely unknown, and very exciting paths!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I like to play sports, mostly softball and volleyball.

I stayed in Southern California for college and graduate school. In 2007, I started at NASA Langley Research Center in Virginia.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Describe the first time you made a personal connection with outer space.</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As a kid I never really dreamt of working for NASA, but in college I became interested in environmental chemistry because it was a way to study the world around us. It was only then that I realized all the great work NASA is doing to help us understand and protect our home planet.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin clearfix'></div>\n<div class='quote'>\n&ldquo;The people who inspire me the most are those who showed perseverance in their life and in science.&rdquo;\n</div>\n<footer>\n<cite>- A photo of Andreas Beyersdorf</cite>\n</footer>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin'></div>\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>How did you end up working in the space program?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In graduate school, I studied how air pollution from cities can travel to remote places and affect air quality throughout the world. This research allowed me to travel to Greenland and Antarctica. Much of this work was with NASA scientists, and through this collaboration I got a job at NASA. Here I make airborne measurements of aerosols, which are tiny particles in the air that can be detrimental to human health. Our measurements help understand their sources and hazards, and help improve measurements from satellites.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is an atmospheric chemist?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I am an atmospheric chemist, meaning I study chemical reactions that happen in the air around us, such as those that produce smog from vehicle and industrial emissions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mainly I focus on aerosols, small particles in the air that can be harmful in high concentrations (such as seen in large cities). To study aerosols, we fly airplanes in locations throughout the world to find their sources. But what is most interesting to me is what happens once they are released: they change due to chemistry occurring in the atmosphere. These changes are important to understanding their role in our climate and their health hazards.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career.</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I recently returned from South Korea, where I participated in a study of their air quality (<a href='https://www.nasa.gov/content/2016-earth-expeditions-korus-aq' target='_blank'>KORUS-AQ</a>). We flew over pretty much the entirety of the country. The view was great, with beautiful countryside and immense cities, but it was diminished by pollution. Our goal was to try to find out what the sources of this pollution are and to help satellites to be able to study this pollution in the future. It was also interesting talking to both Korean scientists and non-scientists who are very interested in improving their air quality. It is encouraging to know that the work we did in Korea may someday be used to improve the lives of millions of people.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='center image_module' style=''>\n<figure class='inline_figure'>\n<img src='/images/content/beyersdorf_835.png'>\n<figcaption>\nAndreas Beyersdorf holds a wing-mounted cloud instrument in front of the NASA C-130 upon its return to NASA Langley after the 2016 North Atlantic Aerosols and Marine Ecosystems (NAAMES) project.\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The people who inspire me the most are those who showed perseverance in their life and science. I had the opportunity to work in the same research group as Dr. Sherwood Rowland, a winner of the Chemistry Nobel Prize for relating how chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) released by spray cans and some manufacturing processes can destroy the ozone layer, which is vital for protecting us from hazardous ultraviolet (UV) light. When a ban of CFCs was proposed, it was met with a lot of pushback including personal attacks on Dr. Rowland. It would have been easy for him to stop doing interviews and let his \"research speak for itself,\" but instead he continued to be an advocate for the ban because he knew it was important. Thankfully it worked, and now there is a ban and the ozone hole is starting to heal.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I think for any career the best advice is to get experience as early as possible. For the sciences, some labs will let high school students do research during the summer. It helps you to understand if it is for you. Volunteering at a hospital helped me to learn that a career in medicine was not a good fit for me, and it was only then I found my interest in environmental chemistry.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I play basketball, kickball, and any game that allows me to be competitive but still have a good time.

I did want to become a scientist when I was younger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I moved to Florida when I was 13-years old. Before moving there I had not thought about space a whole lot -- living in Florida closed that gap for me. There, I saw multiple space shuttle launches from the <a href='http://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/home/index.html' target='_blank'>Kennedy Space Center</a> (KSC). I also had a high school physics teacher that had worked for NASA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During my second year of college I entered a Mr./Miss Central Florida Community College (CFCC) pageant and one of the categories was to come out in an outfit of the job you wanted in the future. I strolled out in a lab coat with the NASA insignia on it! There are times when I still can't believe I am actually working for NASA!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><blockquote>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin clearfix'></div>\n<div class='quote'>\n\"Don't worry if you can't get excited about science, math or engineering and still want to work for NASA: There are so many other areas and positions that NASA utilizes in order to carry out its mission.\"\n</div>\n<footer>\n<cite>- Angela Melito</cite>\n</footer>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin'></div>\n</blockquote></span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>How did you end up working in the space program? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>After I completed my associate degree in physics from CFCC, I decided to pursue a Bachelor of Science degree in engineering physics from Embry Riddle Aeronautical University (ERAU). My senior design project consisted of working with a team comprised of eight of my classmates: we were tasked to design a spacecraft mission. We decided to design a spacecraft that would go and explore one of the moons of Jupiter in search of water. I was in charge of designing the power subsystem and I decided to use a new technology (a nuclear fission reactor). This meant I had to not only produce all of the engineering aspects of my design, but also the safety aspects of the design as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the project was complete we decided to enter it in a nationwide competition. At the end of our presentation we were approached by the vice president of engineering from Swales Aerospace Company in Maryland. He had enjoyed the team's presentation so much that he invited three of the team members to the company to interview for jobs. This is how I landed my first job. This job was the \"launch board\" to obtaining my job as a NASA civil servant two and half years later.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Both of my parents inspired me as I was growing up in different ways. My mother was a stay-at-home mom when my siblings and I were younger and she was dedicated to allowing my siblings and I explore anything we were interested in. I was interested in many sports, acting and science: she would drive me around to all of my events, without complaint, and always encouraged me to pursue what I loved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My dad worked very hard to support our family. He was away from home a lot because of his work at various nuclear power plants. I saw, as I was growing up, what hard work meant and how important it was to my dad to show his family we would be taken care of no matter what. When he was home during \"transitions\" -- between working on one power plant and the next -- he would attend every activity my siblings and I were involved in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both of my parents were also very family oriented and we got to spend a lot of our time with relatives and enjoying the closeness of a family.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is a Deputy Chief Safety and Mission Assurance Officer? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A chief safety and mission assurance officer (CSO) is in charge of preparing and running the safety and mission assurance aspects of a spacecraft or a science payload. The CSO leads a team consisting of safety, reliability, hardware and software quality, parts, and materials engineers, and plans and coordinates the efforts of the engineering teams in performing quality engineering, while at the same time providing technical direction for complex system development. The CSO also establishes the necessary application of quality assurance disciplines pertaining to the project contractors and in-house development activity. The CSO evaluates all contributions and integrates the recommendations of team members including the identification of critical technical problems and proposed solutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career. </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I was accepted to a NASA-wide program called the Mid-Level Leader Program (MLLP) in 2012. During this program I was a part of the Shuttle Transition and Retirement Program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was there when the Enterprise Shuttle was prepped at the Dulles Airport and transported to New York. I also flew out to New York to see Enterprise arrive at JFK and was there for the offload. And I was at Dulles Airport for the offload of the Discovery shuttle. I was privileged to go inside Discovery and see what the astronauts saw firsthand. I not only toured the inside of Discovery, but I also was allowed to sit in the flight commander's seat!! While at Dulles airport, I was given a tour of the inside of the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft (SCA) as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And lastly, I flew out to LAX for the Endeavour offload. I walked with Endeavour through the streets of Los Angeles from the airport to the California Science Center!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I would tell them to go for it! I can't think of a more exciting or rewarding career. Every day I feel very blessed to have been given this opportunity. I would also tell them to take their time in college and figure out what type of engineering interests them the most. Any engineering degree will be transferable in the aerospace industry and you just never know what kind of job you will land! There isn't a particular degree that encompasses my field of safety and mission assurance. Just about any engineering degree will help you pave your way into this field.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I love to travel in my spare time. Lately, I have been traveling to try to see as many of the national parks as possible. I enjoy their beauty and the hiking. I am also involved in numerous flag-football leagues and tennis meet-ups in the Baltimore and Washington D.C. area. My family and friends are very important to me as well, so I try to see them as much as possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I would tell students today that a degree in science, math or engineering is invaluable. In college you will gain skills that can be used in almost any industry and, most of all, through these programs you will gain problem solving skills that will help you not only at work, but in life in general as well. I would also tell students to get involved in what you love. Don't worry if you can't get excited about science, math or engineering and still want to work for NASA: There are so many other areas and positions that NASA utilizes in order to carry out its mission.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><b>Read More:</b><br />\r\n*<a href='http://moon.nasa.gov/home.cfm' target='_blank'>NASA's Moon Site</a><br />\r\n*<a href='http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/ladee/main/index.html#.UjtZgoasjTo' target='_blank'>NASA's LADEE Mission Site</a></p>\r\n",

I went to school at Cornell University and headed for Texas for graduate school. I never left.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Describe the first time you made a personal connection with outer space.</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My father was a navigator on B-24s during World War II, so he liked to point out the constellations to me. You couldn't see many around New York City though, but he tried.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>How did you end up working in the space program?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>When I was an undergraduate physics major at Cornell University in the 1970s, I had an advisor who suggested that his students take one class in every science discipline. I knew nothing of astronomy and so I fit astronomy into my schedule first and fell in love.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During my junior year, I started to work for Joe Veverka. He was also involved in lots of space missions. When I went off to grad school, he stayed interested and suggested directions for me to pursue as a grad student. When the comet rendezvous/asteroid flyby mission came around, Joe Veverka was the one who encouraged me to apply to be on the imaging team.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><blockquote>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin clearfix'></div>\n<div class='quote'>\n\"Perseverance and hard work are more important than smarts.

He was very encouraging for my career.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is an Assistant Director of the McDonald Observatory and a Senior Research Scientist? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I am the assistant director of the <a href='http://mcdonaldobservatory.org/' target='_blank'>McDonald Observatory</a> and a senior research scientist at the University of Texas at Austin. McDonald Observatory is an arm of the University of Texas at Austin and is located in the Davis Mountains of west Texas. It is absolutely beautiful and very remote and dark. As assistant director, I am responsible for overseeing the telescope scheduling, which includes running the Telescope Allocation Committee. I also help in the planning for projects and budgets. Additionally, I am the head of our computing group, though generally more as a supervisor than as a worker (I do help out with users when needed).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As senior research scientist, I study the chemistry of comets for what they can tell us about the origins of our solar system.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career.</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My favorite moment is when <a href='multimedia/display.cfm?IM_ID=1852' target='_blank'>comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 impacted Jupiter</a>. We observed it with all the telescopes at McDonald Observatory. It was quite exciting watching <a href='PLANET:Jupiter' target='_blank'>Jupiter</a> changing before our very eyes and being tied in with all of the other observers at other observatories. Each night, after Jupiter set, we would work for a few more hours to get things ready for the morning news conferences at Goddard. It was exciting, and it was fun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Similarly, I was at the Keck Observatory during the impact of the Deep Impact spacecraft with comet Tempel 1. We had to plan observations when we did not know what to expect. We obtained an extraordinary data set and again, being part of the world-wide team was exciting. Having a front row seat at Keck was also wonderful.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The first piece of advice is that if you are not passionate about science and the scientific process, find another career. The second piece of advice is, learn to like (or at least not dislike) writing -- it is what we do for a living. Third, don't pick a sub-field because it is popular today. It might not be popular tomorrow, or you might not be able to stick it out. Fourth, you can always change your mind. It is harder to change directions when you are on soft money, but even then you can do it. Fifth, have a life outside the field too. It makes what you do for a living a little more balanced. Also, one of the perks of our field is that you get to travel -- sometimes to neat places -- take advantage of this.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I bicycle, do advanced and challenge square dancing, and drink and collect wine.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Perseverance and hard work are more important than smarts.

I used to bundle up in layers of blankets and towels and such to where my eyes were only peeking out in order to protect myself from the bugs.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin clearfix'></div>\n<div class='quote'>\n\"Turns out, problem solving and tinkering are two of my favorite things.\"\n</div>\n<footer>\n<cite>- Ann Devereaux/A head and shoulder image.</cite>\n</footer>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin'></div>\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>How did you end up working in the space program? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I have always loved the idea of space -- the vast unknown frontier. Growing up near KSC, many of my friends' parents worked for <a href='http://www.nasa.gov/' target='_blank'>NASA</a>. So, for me, working for NASA one day seemed like an attainable goal; that I could have a career in space exploration too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the defining moment for me was when I was a high school senior: I was selected to intern at KSC through <a href='http://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/9-12/learning/NASA_SHARP.html' target='_blank'>NASA SHARP</a> (Summer High School Apprenticeship Research Program). I had a fantastic time, met friends who I am still close to after all these years and pretty much set my sights on a future career with NASA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, during my sophomore year in college, I was the first in line to interview with NASA's <a href='http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/' target='_blank'>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</a> (JPL) for a summer job, which got my foot in the door -- I've been working here ever since.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I had a wonderful mentor, Mike Padgett, at KSC who was a major source of inspiration for me. Mike is an engineer and I was really impressed with his approach to composing and then solving problems. He has a great lab, and we would spend a lot of time tinkering with equipment in order to get whatever problem we were looking to solve right.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Turns out, problem solving and tinkering are two of my favorite things. I had always thought I might go into astronomy or some other science discipline, but working with Mike showed me what a real engineer does, and I knew that was what I wanted to do for my career.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is a flight system engineer? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I'm a flight system engineer, which is to say, I'm the lead system engineer for a flight system (i.e. a <a href='missions/' target='_blank'>spacecraft</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In flight projects, system engineers are responsible for breaking down the desired functionality of a mission by figuring out what pieces are needed (sub-systems to do communications, to manage power, to do command and control of the spacecraft, etc.), as well as the performance needs of each part.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We work with the engineers building the subsystems to iron out any problems or unforeseen issues as they arise. When the engineers deliver their equipment, the system engineers are responsible for knitting everything together and validating the spacecraft's software: the \"brain.\" This brain controls all the different parts that make up the spacecraft.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career. </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I had the amazing opportunity to be part of the landing team for the Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity rover. Nothing in my life can compare to that night when we saw Curiosity touchdown on <a href='PLANET:Mars' target='_blank'>Mars</a> and send back her first pictures showing that she had made it. My goal is to someday surpass that moment with one of our new missions.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Don't be too focused on one goal. I think so much of what makes a person unique is all the serendipitous opportunities that they pursue; everything you do in your life adds to your own distinct perspective and your ability to judge new situations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You do need a good basis in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) education so you can understand the fundamentals needed for space flight. However, the mark of a true engineer has a combination of creativity and practicality, which only comes from trying things out for yourself.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I still love to be outside, just like when I was a kid, so hiking and tennis are two favorite pastimes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My engineer husband and I also love to tackle decidedly low-technology problems like raising chickens, curing our own olives, brewing beer, and cooking from scratch from our big garden. I'm very lucky that during the week I'm working with the most advanced technology for high-reliability missions in our solar system, but on weekends I bake bread using wild yeast harvested from the windowsill.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Don't mistake school for what your eventual work life will be. For example, I was always a terrible student in math -- I loved the concepts, but hated having to work through giant calculations. Science and engineering are both such rich disciplines that you can find a vocation which both drives your passion, but also matches the kind of work you like to do. School just gives you the foundation of knowledge so that we all have a common vocabulary. When you start your career, that's when you really develop the specific skills you'll need for the job you have to do.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><b>Read More: </b><br />\r\n*<a href=' http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/' target='_blank'>Mars Science Laboratory</a><br />\r\n*<a href=' http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/mars2020/' target='_blank'>Mars 2020 Rover</a><br />\r\n*Ann is featured in the documentary: <a href=' http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2319340/' target='_blank'>Mission to Mars: A Horizon Special</a></p>\r\n",

A photo features her steering her boat Red Shift -- named for Einstein's law describing one effect of gravity on light.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The instrument she helped create for NASA's Terra satellite measures light and radiance. Anne has helped skipper the satellite along since the very beginning and heads the instrument's U.S. science team. Anne uses the satellite data to study lava fields in Hawaii. Her colleagues describe her as a founder in the critical field of remote sensing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Born in Auburn, Wash., Anne moved with her family to Alaska when she was 6. Her family homesteaded 160 acres on the Kenai Peninsula, where her father built his own log house.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were no schools and no roads. \"For high school, my brother and I went to the town of Kenai,\" says Anne. \"They let me graduate when I was 16. My parents looked around -- there were ten families in our area -- and said that there are no eligible bachelors here, you need to go to college to meet some.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='image_module right' style='width: Magazine cover featuring Anne Kahle on her boat.px;'>\n<figure class='inline_figure'>\n<img alt='FILE:Kahle_Yacht.jpg' src='/images/content/Kahle_Yacht_feat.jpg'>\n<figcaption>\nAnne steers Red Shift in a Yachting magazine cover photo.\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Anne did find love at the University of Alaska. She started out studying agriculture and switched to wildlife management. \"Then I was offered a job in the geological institute and I fell in love with geophysics.\" She worked with renowned British mathematician and geophysist Sydney Chapman, a pioneer in geomagnetism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While completing her master's degree, she fell in love again, this time with a fellow Earth scientist, Jim Kahle. After graduation, they married and moved to Nome. \"We had four kids in five years,\" says Anne, \"I call those my barefoot and pregnant years.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When her husband wanted to go to graduate school at UCLA, the family moved to southern California. Anne went to work at the Rand Corporation on geomagnetism and climate modeling. \"One major factor in climate modeling is the heat balance of <a href='PLANET:Earth' target='_blank'>Earth's</a> surface,\" Anne says. \"Modelers want to know just how much heat is being exchanged between the surface and the atmosphere. This is a job for remote sensing.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anne continued her studies and ended up working for NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena. She helped design a thermal scanner that was first tested on aircraft and then selected to fly in space.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"I'm not an engineer,\" Anne said. \"I couldn't build an instrument if my life depended on it. But I got to say I want it to do this and to do that and make decisions about the inevitable trade-offs.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anne still enjoys her job. \"I like the team, the people, the data, and the travel.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But she has other interests, too, including three grandchildren. Sailing has given away to another passion.\" I'm an avid bird watcher,\" she says. \"I've been bird-watching in all 50 states and all over the world.\" Her lifetime bird list, kept \"compulsively,\" includes 4,260 different species. Now that her husband is retired, he shares the travel, fishing while Anne adds species to her list.</p>\r\n",

My father -- Henryk Jerzy Chmielewski -- is a famous Polish cartoonist. Since my father is a cartoonist and a funny guy, he decided to name me Artur Bartholomew so that my initials would be: \"A.B.C.\" People still call me: ABC. (Who wants to struggle with \"Chmielewski,\" anyway?)</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Describe the first time you made a personal connection with outer space.</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I always wanted to work for <a href='http://www.nasa.gov/' target='_blank'>NASA</a> and study space, particularly ever since I found out NASA existed. This was not easy, especially since the communist government in Poland only praised the Russian space program and concealed any NASA triumphs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In college, I almost failed English 101 because my essays strayed off topic. The professor would write in huge red ink: \"Art, every one of your papers veers off topic and ends up discussing life on Mars. No more Mars. There was nothing in the book about Mars!\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><blockquote>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin clearfix'></div>\n<div class='quote'>\n\"Throw yourself into a mix of the brightest people you can find, do hard work for the smartest person you know, soak up the wisdom and before you can say 'General Purpose Heat Source Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator' you too will be radiating wisdom.\"\n</div>\n<footer>\n<cite>- Art Chmielewski</cite>\n</footer>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin'></div>\n</blockquote></span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>How did you end up working in the space program? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I was excited to study in the US because it brought me \"one giant leap\" closer to my dream future job at NASA. When my counselor at the University of Michigan asked me what I was interested in, I did not hesitate to say, \"space and robots!\" \"There is no such job,\" she said. To prove her wrong, I called the <a href='http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/' target='_blank'>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</a> (JPL) every week to ask about job opportunities, but to no avail. I had to change my strategy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I signed up for job fairs held on campus for various Southern California companies. My interviews went well and I was invited to visit their Los Angeles facilities. I attended my interviews in the morning and in the afternoon drove to JPL to badger the managers there for a job.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On my third attempt, one JPL supervisor told me that while he could not hire me for a space job, my summer work experience at Ford Motor Company qualified me for the JPL electric car program. I took the job without a second thought and, after the project was cancelled, I quickly moved to work on space missions, such as Galileo and Ulysses.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who or what inspired you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In college, I was fascinated with the <a href='http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/spacecraft/goldenrec.html' target='_blank'>\"Murmurs of the Earth\"</a> project for the Voyager 1 mission. I avidly followed the collection of sounds, songs and images for the <a href='multimedia/display.cfm?IM_ID=1779' target='_blank'>Golden Record</a> mounted on the Voyager 2 spacecraft. I wondered how an alien civilization would interpret the pictures that we were sending out into space. I still question it to this day: Will they think that dolphins fly above the sea with anti-gravity fins? Will aliens look at pictures of our bodies and think that we are really gross?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I also remember when Carl Sagan spoke about extraterrestrial intelligence and I wondered if extraterrestrials would find the recorded whale sounds more pleasing than Chuck Berry.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is a Project Manager? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A project manager is in charge of a space mission. He or she ensures that a spacecraft will function as promised within budget. The most important part of the job is maintaining good information flow among the team.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Spacecraft are incredible feats of brilliance by many people across several fields. Scientists, mechanical engineers, electrical engineers, radiation engineers, thermal engineers, test engineers, communication engineers, safety engineers, computer engineers, and countless others must communicate well, document their work and remain focused on an end goal through the ups and downs of the process.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career. </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Several years ago, I was the project manager for a tennis-court-sized inflatable antenna deployed in space. The images of the antenna deploying in space intrigued (then NASA administrator) Dan Goldin, who called JPL and said: \"Congratulations on the inflatable antenna. What's next?\" In response, JPL and the L'Garde Inc. engineers who had worked on the project brainstormed future ideas. We decided that our long term goal should be building a telescope that could image an Earth-like planet in another star system. After a quick calculation, we realized that 27 telescopes -- each the size of the Rose Bowl -- floating in space and working in tandem were necessary to get a magazine cover picture. When we sheepishly mentioned this to Dr. Goldin the next day, his response was not, as we had feared: \"You are a bunch of crazies.\" Instead, he asked us to create the Gossamer Program. The excitement, inventions and creativity that followed in the next five years were unprecedented. We were creating a new discipline of engineering; everything was surprising and frequently non intuitive.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Throw yourself into a mix of the brightest people you can find, do hard work for the smartest person you know, soak up the wisdom and before you can say \"General Purpose Heat Source Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator\" you too will be radiating wisdom.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I love teaching kids how to play competitive tennis. Advanced tennis requires conditioning, speed, technique, reflexes, strength, but most of all mental rigor. It is quite a challenge combining all of these elements (probably harder than building large inflatable space telescopes). Teaching my kids how to play tennis and still be their loving daddy at the same time is tricky business.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I remember reading a series of books by Leo Frankowski. (I think it was called \"The Cross Time Engineer.\") The protagonist, an engineer, travels back in time to the Middle Ages. Here, in a world without books, the Internet or calculators, he has to depend on his own knowledge. I always tell my kids and students to question themselves when doing homework: \"Do I really understand this topic?\" \"If I were suddenly transferred 500 years in time would I be able to teach people about trigonometry, physics, astronomy?\" \"Which inventions could I recreate?\" \"Would I be the smartest person on the planet?\" Strive to say \"yes!\" to all these questions.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><b>Read More: </b><br />\r\n*<a href='http://rosetta.jpl.nasa.gov/' target='_blank'>The Rosetta Website</a><br />\r\n*<a href='missions/profile.cfm?Sort=Alpha&amp;Letter=R&amp;Alias=Rosetta' target='_blank'>More About the Rosetta Mission</a><br />\r\n*<a href='http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/lecture/webcast/jun01/rframedlecture.html' target='_blank'>From Galileo to Gossamer: 400 Years of Telescope Technology</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Links to Videos, Stories, etc. </b><br />\r\n*<a href='http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/video/?all_videos&amp;id=165' target='_blank'>First Person: Art Chmielewski</a><br />\r\n*<a href='http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/education/videos/playVideo.cfm?videoID=17' target='_blank'>Kitchen Comet</a></p>\r\n",

Two events took place that had a great effect on me. At the time, I had no idea how these would shape my life and lead me to where I am today. The first thing that fired my imagination regarding planetary science was in 1979, when the NASA Voyager spacecraft discovered active volcanoes on Io, one of the moons of Jupiter. I knew about Io, I'd seen it through my telescope, but the fact that it had active, erupting volcanoes was wonderful to me&mdash;the conventional wisdom of the time said all of these outer solar system moons were inert, dead ice balls.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second interesting event was the following year, when Mount St. Helens erupted&mdash;and showed how even the mainland United States was vulnerable to volcanic eruptions. My love of astronomy has stayed with me all my life, and kept me focused on my studies through high school. I worked hard as an undergraduate, and focused more on geology, which was new to me, but which I found fascinating. My final year project examined volcanoes on Earth and Mars. I moved on to a Ph.D. at Lancaster University in the United Kingdom, where I studied volcanoes on Io and how they might erupt. I was lucky to be mentored by Professors Lionel Wilson and Harry Pinkerton. Lionel, especially was (and still is) at the forefront of mathematical volcanology, uncovering the secrets of volcanic eruptions through an understanding of the underlying physics. I finally ended up at the <a href='http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/' target='_blank'>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</a> (JPL) in 1994 as a post-doctoral associate, studying Io's volcanoes, and then I was on the Galileo science team. I'm still at it, studying the extraordinary volcanoes on Io and also those on Earth. I now consider myself to be an Io expert&mdash;I have even written the definitive book on Io's volcanoes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><blockquote>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin clearfix'></div>\n<div class='quote'>\n\"The first thing that fired my imagination regarding planetary science was in 1979, when the NASA Voyager spacecraft discovered active volcanoes on Io.\"\n</div>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin'></div>\n</blockquote></span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is a volcanologist?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I study volcanoes&mdash;how they erupt, and why&mdash;and what they tell us about the interior not only of the Earth, but other planets and satellites across the solar system. Volcanoes have had a tremendous effect on the evolution of all the solid planets and many of the moons in the solar system. Volcanoes are windows into the interior of a planet&mdash;we see what the interior is made of because volcanoes erupt this stuff onto the surface where spacecraft can see it. Studying them here on Earth helps us understand how they work <i>out there.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><div class='column-width image_module' style=''>\n<figure class='inline_figure'>\n<a class='inline_image_enlarge fancybox' href='/system/internal_resources/details/original/647_Erta_Ale_Ethiopia.jpeg'>\n<img alt='Erta Ale Ethiopia' src='/internal_resources/647'>\n<div class='enlarge_icon'></div>\n</a>\n<figcaption>\nVisiting Erta'Ale in Ethiopia in 2009.\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What was it like the first time you witnessed a volcano erupt?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The first volcano I saw actually in eruption was Kilauea volcano, Hawai&rsquo;i. I was with my Ph.D. advisor (Prof. Lionel Wilson) and he hired a light plane for an overflight of the volcano. This was in 1988.  When the pilot found out we were volcanologists he gave us a grand tour, standing the plane almost on its wingtip as we circled low over the Kupaianaha lava lake. The lake was very active, and it was a spectacular sight. I was well and truly hooked. </p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Do you have a favorite volcano?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>On Earth, it's probably a toss-up between Erebus in Antarctica and Erta&rsquo;Ale in Ethiopia. Both volcanoes have an active lava lake at their summits. The Erta&rsquo;Ale lava lake in particular is likely a great analogue for some volcanic features on Io. It is also a perfectly mesmerizing sight, as the lava roils away under a thin crust, and occasionally lava fountains form, which are quite a sight (especially at night). I have a fond memory of sitting on the edge of the crater late one evening, watching the lake perform and just enjoying the spectacle.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What have been some favorite moments in your career so far?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2009 I traveled to the hottest place on Earth, the Afar region of Ethiopia. In August the temperature was over 122 degrees Fahrenheit (50 degrees Celsius). And in the Afar is the volcano Erta'Ale. This volcano has a very rare volcanic feature, an active lava lake, which in 2009 was about 55 m in diameter. This is a churning, spitting, cauldron of molten rock. I was amazed to hear the <i>whooshing</i> as the lava lake churned away, to smell and taste the acrid gases escaping from the lava, and to feel the blast of heat from the molten rock. I was there filming a sequence about Io for a television series called \"Wonders of the Solar System,\" created by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), and it was an amazing experience standing above this extraordinary lava lake discussing volcanoes on Io. The lava lake somehow reminded me of a tiger: beautiful to look at, a creature of immense power that was barely restrained, but if you got too close or were unlucky&mdash;well, it could take your arm off.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A few years ago I went to Antarctica to another lava lake at the summit of Mount Erebus, the world's most southerly erupting volcano. There the temperature was typically -58 degrees Fahrenheit (-50 degrees Celsius). So my job has taken me to the absolute extreme places on Earth, as well as to Io (via spacecraft, at least!)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><div class='column-width image_module' style=''>\n<figure class='inline_figure'>\n<a class='inline_image_enlarge fancybox' href='/system/internal_resources/details/original/650_Observing_Io.jpeg'>\n<img alt='Observing Io' src='/internal_resources/650'>\n<div class='enlarge_icon'></div>\n</a>\n<figcaption>\nObserving Io from Mauna Kea Observatory in Hawaii.\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>How do you overcome challenges?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Never, never, never surrender to circumstance. You come up with a Plan B, and if that doesn&rsquo;t work, then a Plan C. Exhaust the alphabet, if necessary.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A foundation in physics and mathematics is a great help. From an early age I was interested in astronomy. The process never ends&mdash;I'm still learning. Simply put, a lot of my job concerns heat. I think about how heat is lost from an object to its surroundings, and how heat loss affects the body losing heat. The object in question could be a planet, or a moon, or an individual lava flow or lake. A lot of the job is identifying the processes taking place and using physics to understand them under conditions on different planets. To do my job you really need a Ph.D. It is a lot of work, but it is immensely rewarding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><div class='column-width image_module' style=''>\n<figure class='inline_figure'>\n<a class='inline_image_enlarge fancybox' href='/system/internal_resources/details/original/648_Mt_Everest.jpeg'>\n<img alt='Mt Everest' src='/internal_resources/648'>\n<div class='enlarge_icon'></div>\n</a>\n<figcaption>\nHiking to Mt. Everest base camp in 1990.\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It sounds trite, but my work is really fun. I enjoy it so much that it is difficult to separate it from <i>out of work</i> activities as I am constantly thinking about what to do next with volcanoes. My very understanding wife cuts me a lot of slack! But I read voraciously&mdash;military history, thrillers, mysteries, science fiction and books on the history of science. I adore movies, and think that \"The Big Bang Theory\" is not only the funniest thing on TV but reminds me of some of the people I work with&mdash;really.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What are some of your favorite science fiction books and authors? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I read science fiction <i>voraciously</i>. Growing up I read a lot of Arthur C. Clarke and Isaac Asimov.  One of my favorite Clark novels is &ldquo;The Fountains of Paradise&rdquo;, and I love his many short stories.  Try the collection published in &ldquo;Tales from the White Hart&rdquo;.  Asimov came up with &ldquo;I, Robot&rdquo; and others, terrific stories exploring the morality and ethics of early A.I.  Another favourite:  Robert Heinlein&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Moon is a Harsh Mistress&rdquo;.  In recent years I have hugely enjoyed the work of David Brin, Kim Stanley Robinson (his trilogy of martian novels &ldquo;Red Mars&rdquo;, &ldquo;Green Mars&rdquo; and &ldquo;Blue Mars&rdquo; is just fascinating; and &ldquo;2312&rdquo;; and &ldquo;Aurora&rdquo;) and the novels of Neal Stephenson &ndash; including &ldquo;Seveneves,&rdquo; which has the most gripping opening line of any novel I have ever read.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We are living in a new golden age of planetary exploration&mdash;there are spacecraft exploring the solar system from one end to the other, and now JPL is engaged in planning the next big mission to the Jupiter system. It won't arrive for many years, and a lot of scientists and engineers will be needed&mdash;to work on communications, propulsion, instrument design, project management, spacecraft design, scientists to establish the science goals of the mission, the observations that need to be made to meet those goals, the instruments needed to make the observations, and finally to analyze the data collected. So to get to JPL, work hard in school. Find a subject that you enjoy and stick with it. When you hit a rough patch (yes, I certainly hit a few), remember how much you love this subject and use that to regain your footing. I have always had a great deal of self-motivation, and that was a great help. Once you set your mind to do something, keep at it to achieve your goals. Be disciplined in your approach to work. Don't accept compromises regarding the quality of your work. Strive to be the best in your chosen field.</p>\r\n",

Even at that age I could sense the immenseness of the event -- I wanted to go with them. Also, my father had been a part of the Gemini and Mercury missions and I think I naturally picked up on his excitement.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin clearfix'></div>\n<div class='quote'>\n\"Whether anybody ever knows my name or not, they'll see my tracks -- I guess I made my mark on Mars!\"\n</div>\n<footer>\n<cite>- Ashley Stroupe</cite>\n</footer>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin'></div>\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>How did you end up working in the space program? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I have spent most of my life trying to study space in some way. When I was younger, I wanted to be an astronaut, but I quickly discovered that astronauts should not be prone to motion sickness. (Carousels still sometimes make me dizzy!)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In college, I studied physics and astronomy, but the Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 planetary missions soon captured my attention, and I realized that the best way I could contribute to exploring the solar system was to help build the spacecraft that we send out there.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I have been inspired by so many people. My parents always encouraged me to challenge myself and never give up on my goals. I was lucky to have many wonderful science teachers throughout my education as well. I was also greatly inspired by Carl Sagan, Buzz Aldrin, Sally Ride and Richard Feynman.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is a Robotics Software Engineer? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I am a robotics software engineer. My favorite job title is <i>Mars Rover Driver</i>. Being a Mars rover driver is like trying to drive a car using a computer program. We have to define very precise paths with distances and directions or use its auto navigation function, which allows it to reach goals on its own, all while ensuring its safety. The real challenge is figuring out how to translate what we want it to do into step-by-step instructions, then run the commands in simulation and see what it does.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe best thing about working on Mars Exploration Rovers (MER) is working with the rest of the team. It's such a rare opportunity for me as an engineer to work with scientists and other engineers and feel like I'm making a real, significant contribution to furthering science and our understanding of our solar system and the Universe. And whether anybody ever knows my name or not, they'll see my tracks -- I guess I have made my mark on Mars!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career. </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There are so many wonderful moments. If I had to pick one, it would have to be looking at the images that came back from Spirit after the first drive that I had planned and seeing the tracks that I had helped Spirit make while climbing up to the top of Husband Hill, with the spectacular vista of the valley below. I felt like a true explorer.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The best advice I have may sound clich&eacute;, but that's only because it's true: Don't give up, work hard and continue to take on new and interesting challenges. You never know what opportunities you may come across. And there's no magic to becoming a planetary scientist or engineer -- just motivation, dedication and lots of teamwork.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>For fun, my favorite activities are travel, reading and theater -- I'm an active member of the California Institute of Technology's (Caltech) drama community. I enjoy both acting and working behind the scenes.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This piece of advice will sound odd at first -- but don't forget your English classes. The greatest scientists and engineers are not only those who are excellent in their fields, but also those who can successfully communicate their discoveries and inspire others to follow in their path. Writing and speaking are key skills for a career in the sciences and engineering.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><b>Read More</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <a href='http://blogs.jpl.nasa.gov/?author=19' target='_blank'>Ashley's JPL Blog</a><br />\r\n* <a href='http://www-robotics.jpl.nasa.gov/people/Ashley_Stroupe/' target='_blank'>Ashley's JPL Page</a><br />\r\n* <a href='http://marsrover.nasa.gov/spotlight/20051109.html' target='_blank'>Meet the First Woman to Drive on Mars</a><br />\r\n* <a href='http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/gallery/press/spirit/20051107a.html' target='_blank'>Spirit's View at Husband Hill</a><br />\r\n* <a href='http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/home/index.html' target='_blank'>Mars Exploration Rover Mission Page</a></p>\r\n",

Those trips gave me lots of exposure to science, technology and nature. All of these became life-long passions.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Describe the first time you made a personal connection with outer space. </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I certainly remember getting interested in outer space through books and television. I especially loved the idea of robotic spacecraft providing glimpses of other worlds -- worlds that humans would not have been able to see close-up otherwise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Vikings to Mars and the Voyagers to the outer planets both occurred during those years. I would stare at some of the pictures by Viking taken at \"eye level\" of the surface of Mars and be amazed at how familiar it all looked, yet so incredibly far away. As someone who grew up in the 80s, <i>Star Wars</i> and the space shuttle were also, of course, huge influences. But those two NASA robotic probes were my favorites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><blockquote>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin clearfix'></div>\n<div class='quote'>\n\"We really are just tiny human beings using all our intellectual and mechanical strength to sling ourselves virtually to other worlds.\"\n</div>\n<footer>\n<cite>- Ashwin Vasavada/Head Shot</cite>\n</footer>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin'></div>\n</blockquote></span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>How did you end up working in the space program? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I took a rather winding road, not because I didn't have a goal, but because I didn't know how to get there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I started at UCLA in aerospace engineering. Aerospace engineering was close to what I was after, but didn't quite feel right. After learning more about the nature of engineering and science, I realized that science was what really interested me. I switched majors twice in college, once to physics, and then to Earth and space science. Although it took me an extra year to graduate, I finally found my path.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As funny as it sounds, NASA robots inspired me: Viking and Voyager.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I do remember a breakthrough moment while at UCLA. I saw an advertisement for a class in planetary science to be taught by David Paige, a professor there. I had no idea there was such a field. Taking that class and a few follow-on classes in Earth science set me on the road to everything that has come since.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is a Project Scientist? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>At NASA's <a href=' http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/' target='_blank'>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</a> (JPL), we conceive, design, build, test, and fly robotic spacecraft that explore the Earth, the solar system and beyond. It's a fantastic collaboration between scientists, who ask the questions and make measurements to answer them; and engineers, who develop the spacecraft and instruments that provide the means to make those measurements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most scientists who work with NASA spacecraft are based at universities and other institutions around the world. However, a few reside at places such as JPL so they can work closely with the engineers, helping to ensure that the spacecraft will be able to best address the scientific questions at the core of its mission. On Curiosity, we have a few hundred scientists involved, but just about a dozen of us are at JPL (of which I am one).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career. </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Two come to mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One was in 1995, when Galileo arrived at Jupiter. It was my first time working as part of a science team on a NASA mission. We had planned to take some images of Jupiter's Great Red Spot (a large storm). The images arrived overnight, and I came in early to look at them. All of a sudden, it hit me that here I was in this dark student lab, in the second sub-basement of Caltech, looking at a vista of Jupiter that no other human had laid eyes on before. Suddenly I was an explorer, like those who had inspired me before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A more recent moment was in 2011, when Curiosity launched on its way to Mars. I had worked on the mission for seven years, mostly through an unimaginable number of documents and dry meetings. But seeing our car-sized rover look so tiny on top of a massive rocket, and then seeing that rocket take our baby away from Earth in a roar of thunder and fire, it became much more real. We really are just tiny human beings using all our intellectual and mechanical strength to sling ourselves virtually to other worlds.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Find your passion and then follow it. While this may sound clich&eacute;, it is quite important advice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are ways to make money and get powerful and rich. Science isn't one of them. It takes an enormous amount of dedication and sacrifice compared with other careers, and the tangible rewards aren't always clear. But if you have a passion to understand the world around you, and to create knowledge that will become part of human history, science becomes its own reward.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I've been a musician my whole life: drums and piano. Although I don't get to play as much anymore, I do enjoy live music whenever possible. I also love to get out into the desert and mountains. Los Angeles has some incredible scenery within a few hours of driving. Every summer I try to spend a few nights backpacking in the High Sierra.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More related to work, I really enjoy giving talks about Curiosity in classrooms and at other events. I volunteer quite a bit at inner-city schools in Los Angeles too.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>First of all I'd say: That's wonderful! Take lots of classes so you can learn just what kind of science, math, engineering, or technology really excites you. Then work hard and become a real expert in whatever that is. The class work can be hard and not always seem that fun or relevant, but it will be worth it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For college students, I'd advise to think long term. Learn the basics of your field very well, even if it means passing up some early job opportunities to further specialize or obtain your dream job.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><b>Read More</b><br />\r\n*<a href='http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl' target='_blank'>Mars Science Laboratory Website</a></p>\r\n",

I went to college at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, on Long Island, and then graduate school at the University of Arizona in Tucson, Ariz.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Describe the first time you made a personal connection with outer space.</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I wasn't particularly interested in science or space growing up. I enjoyed reading and creative writing more. But I did watch Carl Sagan's \"Cosmos\" with my family. I watched several episodes, but I only clearly remember one: the one with Voyager exploring Jupiter and Saturn -- I was blown away. It wasn't until several years later that I made the decision to pursue science as a career, but I think that \"Cosmos\" planted the seed.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin clearfix'></div>\n<div class='quote'>\n\"Develop critical thinking skills. The ability to reason through any issue, whether in science or in life, makes you a better scientist, engineer and citizen.\n</div>\n<footer>\n<cite>- Barbara Cohen</cite>\n</footer>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin'></div>\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>How did you end up working in the space program?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href='http://www.nasa.gov/centers/marshall/home/index.html' target='_blank'>Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC)</a> didn't have any planetary scientists on staff so I joined NASA specifically to help with the Constellation program. The Constellation program was intended to send humans to the Moon to live there for extended periods of time. MSFC has been responsible for a lot of things related to the Moon: including the human lunar lander, the engineering documents describing the lunar environment, and the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) and its companion, LCROSS. Now I work on new proposals for robotic spacecraft to return to the Moon and to visit other planets as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In high school, I had a chemistry teacher, Mrs. Fish, who made chemistry come to life for me -- something just clicked. As I pursued more science classes in high school and college, I had many excellent teachers who encouraged me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My undergraduate advisor, Don Davis, showed me how to approach problems in planetary science using only my terrestrial geology skills. My graduate advisor, Tim Swindle, showed me how to really open up rocks and read their ages using isotopes. But I am most grateful to my network of friends and colleagues, who share their triumphs and disappointments -- I learn from them every day.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is a Planetary Scientist?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A planetary scientist is someone who studies the solar system and the objects in it to understand how these objects formed and evolved to their present state. I'm most interested in the process of impacts -- we see evidence everywhere of objects colliding in the solar system. Sometimes the craters are small, like Meteor Crater on Earth, but sometimes they are enormous, like the South Pole-Aitken Basin on the Moon, which is 2,500 km across. If a crater that big formed on the Earth in the past, it may have seriously affected life as it was just beginning on our planet. So I try to use the rocks from different planets, moons and asteroids to better understand when these impacts happened and how they affected the rocks we see now.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career.</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Wow, there are so many. I've looked at lunar samples in a way no one has been able to do before, being the first to characterize their minerals and ages. I've gotten to see pictures of Mars fresh off one of the rovers. I've gone to Antarctica to collect new meteorites. I've seen rocket and space shuttle launches in person. I love my job -- I get to learn something new every day.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Keep your eyes open for new opportunities. Always ask for what you need. Say 'yes' a lot. And make sure you really love it, because it's a lot of hard work and long hours, but I find it very rewarding.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I love to travel, especially to warm tropical places for scuba diving. I like being outside -- walking, hiking and rowing. My partner and I like to get together with friends to play strategy-based board games. I've been a potter for a long time now as well -- I love to make beautiful and functional pieces like bowls.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As I said above, I wasn't interested in science for a long time -- until high school, in fact. But before that, I was interested in learning. I learned a lot about language, history, math, and art. All these things add up to becoming a critical thinker -- which to me is the most important skill to have of all. So my advice is to develop critical thinking skills. The ability to reason through any issue, whether in science or in life, makes you a better scientist, engineer and citizen.</p>\r\n",

[laughing]   While the primary responsibility is making sure that we can deliver the promised mission&mdash;including the science on the schedule and budget we commit too&mdash;this entails, in my opinion, more than just tracking the programmatic aspects. Success of the mission relies on the quality of our development and operations. To ensure that, the most important responsibility I have is having a quality Project team. The Project staff of Clipper are the best JPL and Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab has to offer. They in turn assure that the delivery staff are the same. Bottom line in my opinion: The Project Manager's major responsibility is the quality of the team. I guess in that role, I have done a fantastic job!  [laughing]</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment in your career. </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The landing of <a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/phoenix/in-depth/\">Phoenix</a> on Mars.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you? What worked for you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Pepto Bismol [laughs]. I truly believe you need to have implementation and product delivery experience, followed by line management experience, and Project System office experience &ndash; in my case it was flight system, group supervisor and division manager. But I think the real issue is to be well-rounded. From the point of view of delivery, this being an implementation product &ndash; I think you garner a lot of empathy for the team that will be working extraordinarily hard over the course of the project. I think that when I talk to people, they recognize that I understand what they&rsquo;re going through. I think empathy is the key. To me that&rsquo;s the big thing.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun outside of JPL/work? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Outside of work? [Laughs] Well, I wouldn&rsquo;t call it fun, but I think the best thing I do to decompress is spin.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What&rsquo;s your favorite space movie? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Hmm, I can answer &ldquo;favorite science fiction book&rdquo;&mdash;can I do that? <i>Childhood&rsquo;s End</i> by Arthur C. Clarke. Unbelievably good. Written in the mid 1950&rsquo;s, which makes it all the more incredible. Favorite space movie? I didn&rsquo;t particularly care for <i>2001</i> because the book was so much better than the movie. I thought <i>Interstellar</i> was pretty darn good.  </p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Are there aliens on Europa? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Do I think there&rsquo;s <i>life</i> on Europa? Oh, hell, yeah. How can there not be? Just like in the movie, <i>Europa Report&mdash;</i>which, by the way, had project members as consultants. In all seriousness, how can there not be? The way biology formed on Earth, everything points to life on Europa. I don&rsquo;t see how it&rsquo;s possible that there isn&rsquo;t something biological on Europa. I won&rsquo;t call it &ldquo;aliens&rdquo;, but at least the makings of biology. The geology is fascinating, but it&rsquo;s all about the astrobiology. </p>\r\n",

When I was little, I used to go out on my front lawn, lie on a blanket, and stare up at the stars wondering if I was alone. My parents noticed my interest in the stars, and when I was in middle school, they took me on a camping trip to McDonald Observatory in West Texas. I thought I had seen all the stars there were to see, but when I got there, I said \"WOW!\" The stars literally lit up the sky and the milky way looked like a long cloud filled with light streaming across the sky. It was that moment, when I was 12 years old, that I felt truly connected with something WAY bigger than myself. I knew then that we couldn't be alone, and I wanted to help find other life out there in the bright sky.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin clearfix'></div>\n<div class='quote'>\n\"Creating something and watching it take flight was the coolest thing I had ever seen.\"\n</div>\n<footer>\n<cite>- Bekah Sosland</cite>\n</footer>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin'></div>\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>How did you end up working in the space program? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>When was in 8th grade, I got to see Spirit and Opportunity land on Mars. That and my fasciation with the stars drove me to take a class in high school called Principles of Technology. It was a class where we learned about physics by building rockets! It was a hands-on class and although I was super excited about learning how to build rockets, I was also intimidated by the lack of girls in my class. After a couple of months of building rockets, I was SO hooked that not having girls in my class wasn't even a thought! Creating something and watching it take flight was the coolest thing I had ever seen. I never wanted to stop problem-solving. When I was a junior in high school, I applied to the Aerospace Engineering department at the University of Texas (UT) and got in! While at UT, I had internships at Johnson Space Center, SpaceX, and the Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL). I loved them all but chose JPL to work full time and since I started working in August 2013, I have loved every minute!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My high school teacher who taught and created the Principles of Technology class, Brett Williams, is who inspired me. He never gave me the answer to any question I had. He always encouraged me to look up answers or call up companies and ask questions. I wasn't naturally brilliant so I learned to feel comfortable asking lots of questions. He believed in me when I didn't believe in myself. He inspired me to reach for the stars when I doubted if I would even get close to them. I now have reached Mars and am excited to see where else I can go!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is a flight director?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A flight director is a systems engineer. Instead of knowing a lot about one system, we know a good amount about all of the systems on the spacecraft. We make sure that the spacecraft is healthy and happy as we plan the science activities. Flight Directors are also in charge of all activities when uplinking them to the spacecraft. We have the final say on when and if sequences can be uplinked, even over the president!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career. </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Opportunity was designed to live for 90 days in the harsh Martian environment but she is still exploring now 11 years later! Because of her age, software and hardware components are degrading on the vehicle and more recently, the flash memory. I had the incredible opportunity to lead the team to figure out how to solve these flash problems and get Opportunity back into an operational state. We were in the midst of testing the new flight software in the test bed when our Project Manager, John Callas, walked into the room. He asked me if I wanted to be interviewed by CBS Evening News on these flash problems! I, of course, said \"ABSOLUTELY!\" Sitting there with CBS News getting interviewed was by far my favorite moment! Not only was it cool to be on the national news; it was even cooler that my work was important to the whole nation!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Engineering is all about problem solving! Exercise your problem solving skills by solving puzzles or doing thought exercises with your friends or brothers/sisters such as \"if you were planning a trip to Mars, what would you bring?\"</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I love hiking, yoga, and cooking! I love hiking because I love to go outside and explore, yoga for exploring within myself, and cooking for creating new recipes and flavors!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Applying what you learn in school to something you can create with your own two hands is SO important. Try to incorporate as many hands-on projects and crafts as you can! Create, build, discover, and explore something new and interesting to you when you are hanging out at home on the weekends or in the summer. It just might help math, science, and engineering make more sense!</p>\r\n",

I like to describe it as taking the high-view of things, understanding how things interact with each other and making trades that involve multiple teams or subsystems. In a more Earth-like analogy, this is similar to making sure the screen, processor and software on your smartphone work together, and then making trades between how much the phone tries to do for a user versus how much a user has to make decisions for the phone.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career. </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My favorite has to be landing a SUV-sized rover on the surface of Mars. (Is it even possible for another moment in my career to exceed landing a car on Mars?)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Besides that moment, I do recall a day in 2008 when we received the initial parts of what would eventually comprise the Curiosity rover. These parts were to be put together for what we call a system test. (It's a test where we have a unique opportunity to integrate all the parts of the flight vehicle together to test scenarios and functions that require multiple systems working in harmony.) There were long hours and restructuring tests and just plain making things work. It was during this time that I realized that I didn't just enjoy, but actually loved this job and that I was a valuable member of the team.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I recommend it.

I always liked to be outside. So when I went to college I had to find something I could do to be outside. Well, geology was really cool to me, because I could go out into the field, look at the outcrop and try to figure out what was going on there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Twelve years ago I was working with Mars Pathfinder, and I thought, \"Man, I really like working with robots. This is cool!\" I was fortunate enough to go from the Pathfinder mission to the Mars Exploration Rovers (MER) Spirit and Opportunity missions. Now, I work on the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL, or the Curiosity rover). My job on MSL is to be the interface between the robotic arm and instruments on the robotic arm and the instruments that are onboard inside MSL. Once MSL lands on Mars, we are going to drill into a Martian rock and take samples of the powder from the rock. Then we will put it into two onboard instruments on the spacecraft. My job is to make sure the powder gets to these instruments properly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Being an investigation scientist on a mission is a very challenging job. When a scientist goes through college, by the time he/she gets their Ph.D., they are usually focused on one specific field or topic. But for a <a href='http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/' target='_blank'>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</a> (JPL) investigation scientist, we are the interface between the engineers who build the spacecraft and the scientist who wants their instrument data for their individual research. This means we have to know all aspects of the hardware, software, operations, and the science. I would compare it to being a baseball umpire in a game where the players on each team speak different languages.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The first person to inspire me with regard to science was my 10th grade science teacher Mr. Rowe (Newport News High School, 1970).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is a Geologist? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Here at JPL we work with unmanned spacecraft. I am a scientist in support of missions we have that are exploring Mars. I work helping engineers that are planning missions to understand the different instruments we will use on Mars, including robotics and geologic instruments. My job as a geologist is to go out in the testing field early and find the appropriate spot to test the rover, make sure the data gets back to the scientists and actually train the rest of our science team how to be robotic geologists. Right now my research interests lie in unraveling the geologic history of Mars with an emphasis on understanding the tectonic, structural and paleohydrologic evolution of the Tharsis region on Mars.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Mars Pathfinder mission's launch and landing. This was my first space mission that I had done a lot of work for.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>When I was growing up, I would really say that I was the <i>Bart Simpson</i> of the 1970s. I was pretty lazy and I really liked to have fun. I wasn't the best student. However, now, if someone comes up to me at JPL and asks me to deliver something, that person doesn't have to ask me twice. I deliver whatever is needed. My work ethic has always covered me. Even if you are like me and maybe not the best student, you will find that intelligence will take you a long way, but a strong work ethic will take you a lot farther.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As I get older, I have found out the word \"fun\" has changed. In my early days I loved to play basketball and golf. But at my age, I enjoy spending most of my time with my daughter&mdash;watching her grow&mdash;and working in my yard.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>First, I would ask them why they like science or math. Working in this field is a commitment. You must love what you are doing because it will take a lot of hard work and time. If you do decide to go into this field, don't let anyone talk you out of it. I had several people tell me that I did not have what it took to get to the top. But I have always had confidence in myself and strove to prove them wrong. As a scientist, you are only as good as the notes you take and keep in your notebook. In fact, in the old days, the surveyors and geologists' notebooks were actually like legal documents. Nowadays with laptops you can take computers out in the field, but the most important thing is to take good notes when observing the world around you.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<h3><b>Read More</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>*<a href='http://marsprogram.jpl.nasa.gov/' target='_blank'>Mars Exploration Program Homepage</a><br />\r\n*<a href='http://science.jpl.nasa.gov/people/Anderson/' target='_blank'>Bob's JPL Profile Page</a><br />\r\n*<a href='multimedia/video-view.cfm?Vid_ID=1024' target='_blank'>Watch Video: Our Solar System Through the Eyes of Scientists -- Meet Bob Anderson</a></p>\r\n",

I then went to graduate school at Cornell University and earned degrees in astronomy and space science. I came to the <a href='http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/' target='_blank'>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</a> (JPL) right out of graduate school, where I came to work on the Voyager missions.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin clearfix'></div>\n<div class='quote'>\n\"The most important thing about being a scientist is that you are always on the forefront of knowledge, discovering new things.

I also read a lot.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for the European Space Agency's (ESA) Rosetta mission?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I'm the U.S. project scientist. There is also an ESA project scientist, Matt Taylor. I'm responsible for the NASA end, guiding and directing the science. I participate with the Europeans and make sure that the U.S. instruments are being utilized. The three main instruments are MIRO, an infrared instrument; ALICE, an ultraviolet spectrometer; and IES, the Ion and Electron Sensor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first two are remote sensing instruments, while the IES directly detects particles in the plasma surrounding the comet. MIRO and ALICE are looking at the big picture, while most of the European instruments are focusing right on the comet and measuring fields and particles.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is the most amazing discovery from Rosetta? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The things I find most fascinating are water ice and oxygen. We've known that there has to be water in comets, but we've never been able to detect it so directly before, and Rosetta has done that. From a science point of view, that's probably the biggest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We've also detected molecular oxygen, O<sub>2</sub>, the same thing we have in our atmosphere, and that was not expected at all. It's quite amazing, and we're pretty sure the oxygen has been there since the beginning.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is your favorite part of being on the Rosetta mission?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>OSIRIS, the camera, has been sending out <a href='https://planetgate.mps.mpg.de/Image_of_the_Day/public/IofD_archive.html' target='_blank'>a picture a day</a>. Just looking at those every day--that's the \"gee-whiz\" thing. The dust production and the evidence of water ice coming off-some of these images, I just find them enthralling.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What are you most interested to discover from this mission?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>What powers the jets, and what causes the jets to come up at such explosive speeds? We're starting to see some of the boulders: are those boulders spewed up from the jets? It's interesting to see what a comet looks like up really close. The holes we see all over the comet may have been areas of previous jetting.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The most important thing about being a scientist is that you are always on the forefront of knowledge, discovering new things. When you work in space science and analyze data coming from a spacecraft, you can learn and experience things that have never been seen before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Curiosity is the number one thing in science. You have to dig down. You have to be a glutton for knowledge. The second thing is to be persistent and never give up. When you're a knowledge worker and increasing knowledge, there will always be pitfalls and frustrations. You have to not care about that. You have to press on regardless. Those are the two things: curiosity and persistence. You have to possess those in infinite measure.

I probably woke up the entire block with my shouts and exclamations! Soon thereafter, I joined the local amateur astronomical society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My association with amateur astronomy allowed me to advance through a progression of larger and larger telescopes, and it inspired me to spend many nights on mountain tops and in observatories learning my way around the sky and a range of astronomical equipment. This association also led to my formal studies of astronomy, which extended through graduate school.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the same time that I was being introduced to the wonders of astronomy, I was inspired by the adventure of the early manned space program. On the same day that I woke up ridiculously early to watch Alan Shepard's first space flight, my parents came home with my brand new baby sister -- that was a very memorable day. I watched every launch from then on through Skylab; however, no new siblings were forthcoming.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><blockquote>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin clearfix'></div>\n<div class='quote'>\n\"Don't get discouraged! Especially when it comes to space missions, a high percentage of proposals that you work on will not be selected for funding.

As the people here got to know me, my interests and my experience, opportunities to turn this into a career became available. I frequently tell people that volunteering is a great way to get to know the various projects and organizations within NASA. Volunteering also helps you to see what most interests you, allows key people to get to know you and gets your foot in the door.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The astronauts of Mercury through Apollo were a major source of inspiration for me as a child, as were the astronomers Carl Sagan and Patrick Moore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While I was growing up, I especially benefited from a wide range of mentors in the amateur astronomy community. Amateur astronomers are a dedicated group of diverse individuals who make real contributions to the science of astronomy. They discover comets, asteroids, supernovae, and are a key source for observational data in many areas such as variable star studies. This key aspect is why astronomy is different from most other fields: amateurs/citizen scientists can still make important discoveries. Becoming a part of this community at an early age provided me with inspiration and direction which still guides me to this day.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is a Mission Education and Public Outreach (EPO) Lead?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I work to communicate the goals, scientific foundation and excitement of a mission to the public. This means working with the mission's science team, developing a solid understanding of their work and then representing it to a wide range of audiences in ways that are accessible and exciting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I also particularly emphasize in finding ways in which students and the public can directly participate in the mission. That way, the public can help make valuable contributions as citizen scientists and participate in the excitement of lunar exploration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite (LCROSS) mission, I worked with the <a href='http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/' target='_blank'>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</a> (JPL) and the GAVRT Program to have students (from their classrooms) take remote control of big 34-m deep-space communications dishes at the Goldstone Observatory. These students helped monitor the health and status of our spacecraft in flight, providing additional coverage during gaps in the mission's time on the Deep Space Network.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE) mission, I have worked on programs encouraging ground-based observations of lunar meteoroid impacts and meteor counts during the course of the mission.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career.</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There have been so many.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Participating in Mars analog field studies in places like the Atacama Desert, Lassen Peak and the Mojave Desert stand out. Getting the chance -- at the last minute -- to fly on NASA's Aurigid MAC mission and observe fragments of comet Kiess burning up in the upper atmosphere was also quite special (thank you Peter Jenniskens! Working EPO at a space shuttle launch was indeed also unforgettable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the best for me was probably the launch of the LCROSS lunar impactor (a mission I had worked on since it was just a proposal) from Cape Canaveral. There, I was able to gather students and amateur astronomers to participate in the mission for its launch. This place, the site of so many launches that had inspired me as a child, was now where I was able to share the excitement of a Moon launch with a new generation of young people. As LCROSS thundered into the sky, I enjoyed the moment all the more knowing my mother was there too, watching from the VIP area.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Don't get discouraged! Especially when it comes to space missions, a high percentage of proposals that you work on will not be selected for funding. These are only failures if you don't learn anything from them.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I enjoy wine, travel and chasing solar eclipses. I have chased the moon's shadow to view solar eclipses from such exotic locations as the wilds of Africa, the heights of the Andes, the jungles of Central America, the Outback of Australia, the frozen wastes of Northern Mongolia, the base of the Great Wall in China, and the beer gardens of Germany.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Stick with it! An education focused on the areas of science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) will give you a broadened range of opportunities when it comes to career choices. It will also enable you to better cope with the accelerating changes technology will bring to your future workplace. However, as important as STEM subjects are, your success will be closely tied to your ability to communicate. Make sure that your education includes elements to help you to write and speak effectively, and frame your technical work in a social and historical context. This will help you in the crucial task of explaining your work's relevance and worthiness for funding.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><b>Read More:</b><br />\r\n<a href='http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/LADEE/main/' target='_blank'>LADEE Mission Site</a><br />\r\n<a href='http://lunarscience.nasa.gov/' target='_blank'>NASA's Lunar Science Institute's Website</a><br />\r\n<a href='http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/LCROSS/main/' target='_blank'>LCROSS Mission Site</a></p>\r\n",

(It was a collaborative project done with USAF, NASA and several universities.) We worked for a couple of years in order to build that spacecraft. After school, I was talking with a former professor and he mentioned that a company in Los Angeles called the Aerospace Corporation where he had worked was looking for someone who had worked on small spacecraft. I applied and got a job working on NASA and USAF programs.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Carl Sagan always makes me think about the philosophy and science behind the engineering. At times you can get caught up in the day to day activities and lose sight of how amazing it is that we've been able to send robots all over our solar system. We have learned so much -- more than our ancestors would have ever imagined possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is a Systems Engineer? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A spacecraft is built of a lot of different components which require people with backgrounds in many different disciplines: computer science, mechanical engineering, materials science, electrical engineering, radio-frequency engineering, and so on. A design that is optimal for one of those disciplines may be very inefficient for another. A systems engineer typically works to balance all those designs to optimize the system as a whole and ensure that the parts work as required when brought together.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career. </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I worked on NASA's Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) several years ago -- back when the first ideas were coming together on how NASA would land a much larger vehicle than previously attempted on Mars. Watching the team successfully land the vehicle in August 2012 was very exciting for me, even though I was not a part of the team during landing.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Try to learn as much as you can, about as many things as you can. I studied mechanical engineering, but I was also interested in other areas. I asked enough questions about power systems, radios and software that I was able to broaden my skill sets and work in areas other than mechanical engineering and design.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I enjoy live music a great deal and can be found at a variety of concerts around the Bay Area. I also play soccer, basketball and softball in my off-hours, or at least I did before tearing my ACL. I'm currently working on rehabilitating my knee so that I can get back to playing again soon.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Stick with it.

(I had originally thought I wanted to work for Spin magazine writing about rock bands.) Then I had a class with Bob Brown from the Lunar and Planetary Lab at UA. I was fascinated and started becoming more involved in the field of planetary science by working as a preceptor (similar to a student teacher's assistant for the class). This led to being invited to help develop a planetary ices laboratory with Dr. Brown, who convinced me I could do well as a scientist and prompted me to consider pursuing a career in planetary science. At the time I was studying possible D/H fractionation of comets. I used to work all the time, including weekends. It was a labor of love.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then I transferred to majoring in physics and I became interested in early solar system processes. I started working in another laboratory at UA, working with Dante Lauretta on the interaction of nebular gases and metals in the nebular phase prior to accretion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As an undergraduate, I was also involved in a research project studying Europa's lithosphere with Terry Hurford, which led to my first publication. This had aroused my interested in ice geophysics. I wanted to pursue my graduate studies on that topic, but this was when the Galileo mission came to an end, and the funding got scarce. It was a difficult time to get started on studying Europa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Largely because of my diverse skill set from observing and using remote sensing, as well as exposure to meteorites and nebular chemistry, I ended up being offered a graduate student research (GSR) position by Christopher Russell at the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA). Professor Russell wanted someone who had experience with observations and who was knowledgeable in geophysics, especially of relevance to asteroids, to work for the Dawn mission. By happy chance, this was exactly my profile!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During my grad studies, I tried to stay close to the Europa community: I volunteered to serve on the Europa Jupiter System Mission's Science Definition Team by taking notes during their meetings. At the end of my thesis, I had a lot of contacts with that community, and especially with Don Blankenship, for whom I now work. I was lucky to have had an advisor in grad school who gave me flexibility and let me expand my thesis in several directions so that I could develop a broad-based skill set, and get more experience with geophysical studies on top of being involved in asteroid observations.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I have been inspired by a lot of people in a lot of places, most of whom were teachers. I've tried to incorporate pieces of all of these people in my approach to life and to science.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My high school (Flowing Wells) was a great source of inspiration with an incredible group of teachers and administrators who are committed to inspiring students to learn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both my mom and my sophomore honors English teacher and yearbook advisor Jim Brunenkant are the reasons I'm committed to educating and helping people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bob Brown, my first advisor, had an incredible influence by taking interest in and supporting me during a tumultuous time in my life. I probably wouldn't be who or where I am without him handing me the reins, so to speak.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I interned at the <a href='http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/' target='_blank'>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</a> (JPL) with Bonnie Buratti using telescopes to observe seasonal changes on Triton. My interactions with her showed me that it really was possible to succeed as a woman in a non-traditional field. Bonnie played a huge part in my career choices by showing that one can lead a very active professional life, have a family, be a great scientist and encourage other people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My current advisor Don Blankenship is another inspiration. He is a great manager who runs an incredibly successful group that is trying to solve big problems (climate change and life in the solar system) and stays focused on the science no matter what happens. It's amazing what a small group of people can accomplish together.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is a postdoctoral fellow?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I am a postdoctoral fellow at the Institute for Geophysics of the University of Texas at Austin (UTIG) working on ice penetrating radar to study geophysical evolution of ices on Europa and in Antarctica. A postdoctoral fellow is a new researcher who has just finished his or her Ph.D. The fellowship is an award from the Institute for Geophysics. Essentially, I get the freedom to work on any topic that excites me. I've still been writing grants to support myself and others in my group, though, and am partially funded by the Dawn mission and my group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Currently my main focus is the formation of chaos terrain on Europa. This involves comparisons with Earth's cryosphere. When I first started to study terrestrial glaciology I went with my team at UTIG to Antarctica for our field season. We use a plethora of techniques to study the geophysical evolution of the ice and the sub-glacial geology of Antarctica. My role has been to study Europa analogs, and will probably involve in the future studying fracture and water in terrestrial ices. I am hoping to go down to Antarctica again next year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am also interested in icy asteroid evolution and astrobiology, as well as the early history of Vesta. I've recently been appointed as the science team liaison on the education and public outreach team for the Dawn mission to Vesta.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career.</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I have two favorite moments. The first moment was in 2007 when I received our Pallas data from the Hubble Space Telescope: I was at the Space Telescope Institute working with Max Mutchler, and he downloaded the beautiful images, about eight pixels across, of egg-shaped Pallas. I am sure I cried!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From July 2010 (when I arrived in Austin) up till December 2010 I spent time thinking about a particular problem on Europa and what the Earth's cryosphere might be able to tell us about how ice and water interact on Europa. At the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (LPSC) in March 2011, I was excited about my new results, but I hadn't yet shared them with anyone. Over a little table in a restaurant I handed the figure over to Don Blankenship, and his reaction was incredible. It was the great \"Eureka!\" moment. We spent probably another hour discussing the possible implications. I live for those moments in this field -- the feeling that you've just solved something is overwhelming, and I couldn't keep a smile off my face.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The most important thing that I have learned is to work on what you love so that all the time you spend on it has value. Writing proposals and papers, getting proposals rejected, spending all those hours working to understand a problem you're trying to solve, and trying to get established in a new field can be daunting, but if you love what you do it doesn't feel like work!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Be flexible with your path to achieving your goals. For a while, you may have to be a slightly different version of yourself than you imagined, but it's all definitely worth it in the end. I first started thinking about Europa missions almost 10 years ago -- I was 20 when I figured out this is what I wanted to do for my career. I am so excited about Europa -- it was worth taking a more circuitous path to get to the point where I can make a career working on it. Also, my thesis project wasn't what I envisioned when I was applying for graduate school, but it allowed me to develop a skill set and a network that helped me to get where I am now, doing exactly what I always wanted to do. And along the way, I gained exposure I never would have had otherwise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another recommendation I would make is that it is important to develop good relationships with other people in the planetary science community. There are a lot of great people in planetary science! You will learn an incredible amount from these people, and eventually they will remember you for things like invited talks and getting involved in missions. Ways to be involved include, for example, participating in writing white papers, attending focus groups and other service to the community. It's also vital to get out and meet people at meetings, read the literature and ask a lot of questions. Then good people will want to work with you.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I am a huge heavy metal fan, so I try to go to as many concerts as I can, and I constantly have music on in the background. I am a sports addict as well, especially baseball. I watch too much ESPN and not nearly enough Yankees games. I also ride Arabian horses, and I just started showing again after a few years off (it's hard to afford horse shows on a graduate student's budget). I'm a snowboarder, and I am in love with my car, a 1977 Datsun 280 Z.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I'm still really young and just starting out myself. I think an important problem many young scientists face is the <i>impostor syndrome</i>: starting off in a new field is intimidating. I try to remember to have confidence in myself and my abilities (but not too much). I find you have to think for yourself, not let other people choose directions for you. There are many parameters that can influence your choices: colleagues, other political and social forces, personal life, etc. Know what you like and what you want to do, and figure out how to do it. Be humble -- it's important to be able to identify your own weaknesses and be open to new perspectives on your ideas, but don't be afraid to be bold. Take some risks and make contacts with the right people. Have a goal and think for yourself, and you should come out OK.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>This profile has in part been adapted from a post about Britney Schmidt by Susan Niebur for the Women in Planetary Science website.

I also am the day-to-day interface between the science team of the mission and the engineers and technical people who are responsible for implementing the mission. So, I am a team member who tries to integrate the outside science elements with the <a href='http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/' target='_blank'>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</a> (JPL) and the distributed team that is putting the mission together.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>How did you get interested in planetary science? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In my early career work as a marine geophysicist, I studied the Earth's magnetic field as recorded in the volcanic rocks on the ocean floor and motions of the Earth's tectonic plates. After studying all of the aspects of the Earth's magnetic field, the tremendous discovery of the magnetized crust on Mars was revealed. That opened up a whole new area of research for me. I began looking at the differences between magnetic field generation on the Earth and on other planetary bodies, and what it reveals about how they developed. It was then not a large leap to decide to look at the evolution of other planetary bodies, including asteroids.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><blockquote>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin clearfix'></div>\n<div class='quote'>\n\"If you want some adventure, if you want to work hard, if you want to do work with teams ... if you want to see an idea from conception through its ultimate goal, science is a wonderful field to work in. It is highly rewarding.\"\n</div>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin'></div>\n</blockquote></span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>How has planetary science changed since you first entered it? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The field of planetary science has experienced a rapid growth since I first became interested in it. Planetary science is moving from an era of reconnaissance missions, in which we visited all of the planets of the solar system except for dwarf planet Pluto, to one where we're planning highly detailed observations and investigations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, we are on the verge of an explosion of knowledge of what makes up the other bodies of our solar system -- how they evolve and how the whole solar system has evolved over its more than four billion years of evolution.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is it about your work on the Dawn mission that you find most exciting? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Working on the Dawn mission is very exciting because it presents a lot of challenges, and of course along with great challenges come great rewards. Some of the things that really interest and excite me are making the mission happen. It is so wonderful to take something that you conceptualize and then start to go through the process of turning it into a reality. Every step along the way there are decisions to be made. A lot of work has to be done to get all of the details taken care of. There is a tremendous sense of accomplishment when you actually work through each step of the mission and see the final product take shape.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What new science understanding will the Dawn mission provide? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I believe that the Dawn mission is going to teach us a lot about how the inner solar system -- the terrestrial planets -- evolved differently than the gas giants in the outer solar system. Jupiter and Saturn have very low densities; they are gas planets. The inner solar system consists of rocky bodies. In the transition between those two major types of bodies in the solar system lies the main asteroid belt. Within the main asteroid belt, we have identified two of the largest objects, Vesta and Ceres, where we have the same sort of fundamental differences. Vesta, being a higher density, more rocky body, and Ceres looking like a much lower density body that has a lot of water in it. So, we are looking at this fundamental boundary within our own solar system -- how the material changed and evolved at the very start of our solar system. We believe that we are going to learn something fundamental about the beginning of the solar system by comparing and contrasting these two bodies.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to kids considering a career in planetary science? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Start with the basics. Math is very important, but there are a lot of other skills that one can and should have to be successful. Begin with a curious mind, very strong communication and writing skills and the ability to be objective.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then, after getting a good education, don't be afraid to follow your own idea from its conception to reality. Science is one field where you can really make unique contributions, where you can really have your own path through life. It is a wonderful feeling to be able to conceive an experiment, carry it out and feel that sense of accomplishment when it's done. The incredibly tremendous teamwork that goes on in carrying out a complex science experiment, or a mission, is another aspect where you really make life-long experiences and achievements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, my advice would be that if you want some adventure, if you want to work hard, if you want to do work with teams, if you want to see an idea from conception through its ultimate goal&mdash;science is a wonderful field to work in. It is highly rewarding.</p>\r\n",

I always used to wonder why the sky was blue, what made lightning work and plants grow the way they do. I had this spare electric razor my Dad was going to throw away, that I rescued and tore apart and put together and made run forward and backwards. I built a crystal radio and had fun hooking it up to various grounds in the house (from the base of the phone to an electrical outlet) to see what reception I could get. Embarrassing as it is to say, I got bummed out when I read about maximum entropy and the death of the universe, but not as much as Woody Allen in \"Annie Hall\" - I'm not so angst ridden.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a teenager, I had fun with a crazy physicist friend who introduced me to the wonders of non-Newtonian fluids and surface fluids. (You should take some cornstarch and mix it with a bit of water sometime, then squeeze on it - hours of fun in the kitchen sink with soap and water and thin films).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I used to watch the constellations, and wonder what was out there. I have a very good sense of direction and we always seemed to be going somewhere as a kid. I developed a strong sense of discovery and adventure.

Early on, \"East of the Sun, West of the Moon.\" Later, in my pre-teen years, probably the \"Andromeda Strain\" by Michael Crichton and \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" by Arthur C. Clarke.

Without that understanding the Apollo program would have been much more risky.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>How did you end up working in the space program? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I was looking at the Mars Pathfinder website and found listed at the bottom of one of the pages the name and contact information for someone working on the project and I sent them an email. In the email I asked them what it took to get a job at NASA. I received a response requesting my resume, and within twenty-four hours I also received several offers for post-doctoral positions. This was not what I wanted, but we kept in touch and I subsequently was hired to start a research lab at the NASA <a href='http://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/index.html' target='_blank'>Ames Research Center</a> (ARC).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><blockquote>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin clearfix'></div>\n<div class='quote'>\n\"It is always entertaining to see people's expressions when I introduce myself as the Planetary Protection Officer.

(Recently, the European Space Agency's (ESA) planetary protection officer and I were lecturing at a planetary probes workshop, and he put up a picture of \"Men in Black\" on the big screen behind us.

      "body": "<h3><b>Where are you from?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I have moved around a lot in my life, so this is a somewhat difficult question for me to answer! Broadly, I'm from Canada -- I was born in Ottawa and moved slowly westward as my father's job took him to new cities every few years. We eventually ended up in Penticton, British Columbia, which is where I graduated from high school. It's a beautiful town, nestled between two lakes in the mountains, and in the native Salish tongue, it means \"a place to stay forever.\" I had some very supportive high school teachers there, who fostered my interest in space science, and who helped put me on a path to my present career.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Describe the first time you made a personal connection with outer space. </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I'm not sure I could pinpoint one moment where I first made a connection with outer space. As a child, space science was one of many interests, along with music, track and field, and various languages. However, as I pursued these independent interests, astronomy always was a little extra thrilling for me. Some of my favorite moments involved going out into the mountains with the high school astronomy club and looking at stars with my teacher's 8-inch Newtonian telescope. Comet Hale-Bopp was a particularly bright object when I was in high school, and I hadn't realized how lucky I was to be able to gaze upon a brilliant comet every night from our back porch. These experiences, and those like them, inspired me to pursue a degree in space science. Now I can't imagine doing anything else!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><blockquote>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin clearfix'></div>\n<div class='quote'>\n\"I'm particularly eager to get a glimpse </span><span>of Pluto as the New Horizons spacecraft </span><span>flies by this icy world in 2015.\"\n</div>\n<footer>\n<cite>- Catherine Neish</cite>\n</footer>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin'></div>\n</blockquote></span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>How did you end up working in the space program? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As I mentioned, I have been interested in space science ever since I was a child. I was a voracious reader of all types of science fiction, including all of Arthur C. Clarke's novels. However, I did not become seriously interested in a career in space science until high school. In tenth grade, I competed in a space settlement competition sponsored by <a href='http://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/home/index.html' target='_blank'>NASA-Ames Research Center</a> (ARC). My \"Space Station Terra Nova\" won first prize in my age category. This gave me the opportunity to visit NASA Ames, and experience the bustle surrounding the landing of Pathfinder on Mars. Two years later, I won an essay contest sponsored by the Canadian Space Agency, and attended the International Space School in Houston, staying with astronaut Chris Hadfield and his family during my time in Houston. By then, I was hooked, and decided to major in astronomy as an undergraduate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fascinated by the movie and the novel \"Contact,\" I applied for a summer research internship at Arecibo Observatory. There, I had my first taste of planetary science working with Ellen Howell and Mike Nolan researching asteroids with radar. I was fascinated with radar -- this was the first \"active\" astronomy I had ever seen. There you could tweak the buttons and knobs and learn different things about the asteroids, instead of simply collecting what they reflected from the Sun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During that summer, Ellen told me about her Alma Mater, the University of Arizona, and its strong planetary science program. I applied to their graduate program several months later, and was accepted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a second year graduate student, I started working with Ralph Lorenz, who was a Cassini RADAR team member. As a result, a large portion of my Ph.D. dissertation focused on radar observations of planetary surfaces, and in particular Titan, but also Earth and Venus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Several months before I was scheduled to graduate, I received a mass email advertising a new postdoc position at the <a href='http://www.jhuapl.edu/' target='_blank'>Applied Physics Laboratory</a> (APL), working with radar data from the Moon. Though I knew very little about the Moon at that time, I hoped my radar experience would be attractive to the Miniature Radio-Frequency (Mini-RF) team. Luckily, it was, and I started working there shortly thereafter. By learning to work with lunar data, I opened myself up to new research projects, new collaborations and new funding sources that I wouldn't have had working with Titan data alone.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I have been supported and encouraged by many people: teachers, family, mentors, classmates and friends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, I think most of my inspiration has come from fictional characters, in books and in television shows and movies. Through reading Carl Sagan's \"Contact,\" I was introduced to a character that seemed to embody the type of person I wanted to be -- a passionate, well-traveled scientist who searched the skies for unknown species on distant planets. Fiction is a great source of inspiration. It can depict the world as you hope it will become, and can motivate you to make that world part of reality.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is a Postdoctoral Fellow? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Postdoctoral Fellowships are short-term positions, used as a type of apprenticeship immediately after a person graduates with a Ph.D. They tend to last several years, before the person finds a permanent position in academia, government or industry. Often these positions come with quite a bit of freedom to pursue independent research interests. In essence, you are being paid to learn!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In my case, my scientific interests lie primarily in the area of planetary radar. Radar represents the best way to observe the surface of planets with large opaque atmospheres (such as Venus and Titan) leading to a better understanding of their surface morphology. It also provides a wealth of information about the surface being imaged, including topography, composition and roughness. In particular, the unusual radar properties of ice may lead to its detection in the permanently shadowed regions at the poles of the Moon, which has implications for future manned exploration of that body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To investigate this area of interest, I have been involved with several spacecraft missions. I am currently a member of Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter's (LRO) Mini-RF science team, and an associate member of the Cassini RADAR team.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career. </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I think my favorite moments in my career are when I discover something new, or see something that no one else has ever seen before. I think this is why I find Titan so exciting to study -- prior to 2004, no one had ever seen its surface! Amazingly, eight years into the Cassini mission, there are still large areas that have not been imaged at high resolution. Every time we get a new RADAR strip, I eagerly scan through it, looking for weird and wonderful new features. I look forward to these opportunities with each new spacecraft mission. </p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Planetary science is a very broad field, with work ranging from laboratory analysis to computer modeling to remote sensing (and so on), on topics ranging from geology to astrobiology to chemistry to atmospheric physics (and so on). My advice is to \"try out\" as many of these sub-fields as possible, through high school and undergraduate internships, and later, graduate course-work and training, to determine what it is that really excites you about planetary science. Then, find a graduate program that can support that interest, or gives you the flexibility to try out new fields (if you're still undecided). You'll be the most successful if you really love what you're doing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It's also extremely important to network, and the people you meet through your graduate work are probably some of the most important parts of that network. Besides this, postdoctoral positions can be a good way to expand your expertise beyond what you completed during your Ph.D.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I'm an explorer at heart. I love to explore new worlds, whether in our solar system, or here on Earth. During my summer in Arecibo, I learned how to SCUBA dive, and immediately took to our underwater world. In many ways, SCUBA diving is a lot like being an astronaut: exploring an alien environment, weightless and reliant on external sources of oxygen. SCUBA diving also gives me an excuse to indulge in one of my other passions -- travel. Through my work, I have been fortunate to see much of the world, attending conferences in locations ranging from Iceland to Hawaii to Australia. Earlier this year, I traveled to Antarctica as a tourist. This was a real thrill -- since like the ocean -- it is one of the last unexplored places on Earth.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My advice would be exercise your communication skills whenever you get a chance; skills such as writing, public speaking and working in teams. These are skills that are often not explicitly taught in school, especially in math-intensive degree programs, but I would argue, represent half of your work as a scientist. You can find ways to practice these skills outside the classroom by getting involved in student government, participating in public outreach, writing for a newspaper or a blog, and so on. In my own case, I spent many years as a member of the graduate and professional student council at the University of Arizona, learning how to articulate the needs of the students to the university administration, and then negotiate solutions to those needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>This profile has been adapted in part from an original interview conducted by Susan Niebur, for the \"Women in Planetary Science\" website.

      "body": "<h3><b>Describe the first time you made a personal connection with outer space.</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My grandfather had set up a telescope in his yard and we were looking at the stars and a planet (if memory serves me correct, Saturn), and I remember just being completely at awe with the sky. My grandparents also received National Geographic Magazine at their house, so I'd walk there (my house was a half mile away) just to sit and read through the magazine, and I'd get really upset if they tossed away the space issues before I had read them multiple times.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>How did you end up working in the space program?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>When I was a kid, I had three major career trajectories: a gym teacher, a meteorologist/storm chaser, or an astronaut. My mom is still really glad I didn't follow through on that second one, although I do spend far too much time watching hurricane prediction models as a hobby. I tested well in math and physics, so I decided to major in engineering, then moved to physics while still an undergraduate, and at that point began focusing more on astrophysics and planetary science. My first real venture into astrophysics was as a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program at The University of Alabama at Birmingham, working with Dr. Perry Gerakines. I really enjoyed the project, and went straight into my PhD Physics program at UAB after undergrad. After graduate school, I moved on to a postdoctoral fellowship at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, and at that point I knew I wanted a long-term career at NASA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><blockquote>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin clearfix'></div>\n<div class='quote'>\n\"I constantly remind myself how many people helped me to get to where I am in my life today, and strive to pay that service forward to others.\"\n</div>\n<footer>\n<cite>- Christina Richey</cite>\n</footer>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin'></div>\n</blockquote></span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My mother really instilled in me that I could do anything, and she has been my number one inspiration. She did everything she could to ensure her kids had a great life, even when the odds were against us (I proudly admit I come from a poverty-stricken region in the Appalachia). I also had several great teachers, coaches, and family friends as role models during high school and college, and enough people believed in me to drown out the nay-sayers. My undergraduate university, Wheeling Jesuit University, focused on success through service to others, and Father James O'Brien really lived that ideal, so he was a daily inspiration for me for four years. I constantly remind myself how many people helped me to get to where I am in my life today, and strive to pay that service forward to others.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is a Discipline Scientist? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Discipline Scientists manage Research and Analysis (R&A) awards within each division of the Science Mission Directorate. I currently lead in managing the Discovery Data Analysis Program, The Exoplanets Research Program, and help as a secondary on several other programs in both the Planetary Science Division and the Astrophysics Division. Discipline Scientists write the call for proposals for their program, receive the proposals and gather expert panels to deliver recommendations on each proposal, and then gather this information to write a recommendation document to the Lead for R&A, who makes the awards. After the awards are made, the Discipline Scientist monitors each award to ensure the science is moving forward. I'm also the Deputy Science Advisor for SMD, where I help compile and distribute information about the R&A awards from the SMD Divisions, and focus on communication with the greater communities working directly with the SMD. Additionally, I'm the Deputy Program Scientist for the OSIRIS-REx Mission (the Origins Spectral Interpretation Resource Identification Security- Regolith Mission). OSIRIS-REx is scheduled for launch in 2016 and will travel to a near-Earth Asteroid called Bennu and bring back a returned sample to Earth for study. The mission will help scientists investigate how planets formed and how life began, as well as improve our understanding of asteroids that could impact Earth.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Why are anti-harassment policies important?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Workplace climate can promote, (or in the case of hostile conditions, hinder), scientific productivity and innovation. Recent studies, including one that I am a co-investigator on, showed that harassment is an issue within our community, and inappropriate comments, harassment, and assault lead to a number of scientists feeling unsafe in their workplaces, and pursuing fewer scholarly opportunities as a direct result of these experiences. Anti-harassment policies are important because they establish a protection mechanism for vulnerable members of our community and provide a way for addressing hostile work environments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As someone working at NASA HQ in the Research and Analysis Programs, I try to look at this from two fronts. This first is that all people are equal and the disrespectful treatment of another human being is not legal, nor is it something that anyone should be participating in. Second, as a Discipline Scientist, I want my program to be funding the best scientific endeavors possible, by the best scientists possible. Harassment of any kind (based on an individuals race, color, gender, national origin, religion, age, disability, sexual orientation, status as a parent, gender identity, genetic information, etc.) leads to our community members feeling unwelcomed, or worse, unsafe in their field, and take away from a person's ability to do the best science possible due to unnecessary and cruel distractions occurring. Hostile environments lead to a loss of productivity and potentially the loss of new recruits in the field that could bring in new grant money. That's simply not acceptable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Harassment isn't just an issue in one field, or just in STEM, it's a larger cultural issue that we need to overcome. By our community stepping up to this challenge and implementing strong anti-harassment policies, we can help lead the way in combatting this larger cultural issue. Be the change...</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career.</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I think one of the highlights in my career has been helping future scientists progress in the field. This past American Astronomical Society Meeting, I ran into my former intern, Ellen Price. She was a high school intern while I was at UAB as a graduate student, as she had this great love of science, so I knew she'd go far and kept pushing her beyond what I'd normally expect from a high school student. At AAS, she was presenting her poster on characterizing potential exoplanets and I discovered that not was she about to graduate from Caltech with her undergrad degree, but she's be going to graduate school at Harvard to work with Dr. John Johnson, who I am currently serving on a committee (the AAS Committee on the Status of Women in Astronomy) with. She was exactly where she deserved to be, and it was amazing to see her succeed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another proud moment was when my mom and aunt came to NASA Headquarters to watch me receive the Special Service Award last year. They've dedicated so much time and energy into helping me, and my success is just as much their success.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of my own scientific endeavors, I was a participant in the NASA-Nordic Astrobiology summer school in Iceland and spent 17 days learning about water in our universe. We climbed to the top of Eyjafjallajokull, and the lava was still smoldering from the 2010 eruption. Among the lava, we found a baby fern growing. Life can be amazingly resilient some times, and reminders like that make science all the more amazing.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I've actually taken a non-traditional career path (going from scientist to program management so early in my career), so I'd tell them that it's okay to not want to be a tenure-track professor, and to do what they really wanted to with their career. Also, to realize that rejection is a part of this job (I've never met any scientist who has gone through the grueling task of grant and/or journal article writing without rejection at one point in their career), but to focus on the positive and keep your chin up. Also, finding a good support system and mentors will be invaluable, so work to surround yourself with the right people. And to remember those who helped you get to where you are. Lastly, the words that I truly believe have helped me succeed the most in program management are 'please' and 'thank you'. Respect the community you work with and the people around you.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I'm a distance runner and was an athlete through college. I'm actually training now for the Marine Corps Marathon in October, so running is my go-to activity outside of work. I am also looking into my next adventure after that... maybe I'll climb Mt Kilimanjaro?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, I like to think I'm becoming an awesome cook. My friends and family may argue the level of awesomeness to which I have achieved, but I make an amazing Cornish hen and some fantastic lettuce wraps.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I was recently at an outreach event centered on getting minority girls into STEM (The Every Girl Can Conference) and the panel I was participating on was asked if there was one way we could persuade the girls in the room to join our field, how would we do that? It was an unfair question, because an hour before that I had shown the girls lunar soil samples. So my answer was simple: 'who doesn't want to carry the occasional moon rock?' The room erupted with excitement. It's hard to compete with moon rocks...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If they were interested in STEM, I'd tell them to go for it and drown out the nay-sayers. This field is full of wonderful opportunities and through the research we do, we're understanding the basics of how our world, our solar system, and our universe work. What's more amazing than that?</p>\r\n",

      "body": "<h3><b>Where are you from?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I was born in Munich, Germany, but I moved to the U.S. with my parents when I was five years old. I grew up in West Lafayette, Ind., where my father was a professor of medicinal chemistry at Purdue University.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Describe the first time you made a personal connection with outer space. </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Apollo 11's landing on the Moon. It happened shortly after my eighth birthday and we were in the middle of a road trip through the southwest United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Road trips in my family were long and rather strenuous affairs. Often we were out of the hotel by six a.m., and we spent long days driving from one park or attraction to the next (with the four of us kids fighting in the back over who would get the window seats and who had to sit in the middle and share a seat belt).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, on the day of the first lunar landing we spent the entire day at the hotel, watching as Neil Armstrong took his first steps on the Moon. I have to confess that at the time, my eight-year-old self was more impressed with the fact that something could keep my parents glued to a TV set in a hotel room, than I was with the actual lunar landing itself. Over the years, I grew to appreciate the significance of that event.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>How did you end up working in the space program? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of my career, I actually came into space science rather late.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was not particularly interested in science when I was growing up and for a long time I thought I wanted to be a librarian. By the time I got to college, that idea had fallen by the wayside, but I really had no idea what I wanted to do. I was attending Purdue University and majoring in German language and literature, mostly because my family is originally from Germany. However, I was also taking various other classes to try to find something I wanted to make into a career. An accounting class quickly convinced me that business was not it! It took me almost the full four years, but I finally found it when I took an introductory geology class (in order to fulfill a basic science requirement). I was hooked from the start, thanks in large part to a wonderful teaching assistant for the class who had an incredible enthusiasm for all rocks and minerals. Since very few of the classes I was taking as a language major could be applied to a science degree, I actually finished my Bachelor of Arts in German and then essentially started over again in the area of geosciences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Part of the way through this process I transferred to Indiana University, a move that turned out to have a big impact on my future. I had not been there long before Abhijit Basu, a professor I knew only slightly, stopped me in the halls one day and said, \"If you ever think you might be interested in working on some of the Moon rocks, come and see me.\" It was a casual invitation that he probably made to many students, but it completely changed the course of my scientific career. Like so many others of my generation, I vividly remembered the Apollo landings and was fascinated by the thought that man had walked on the Moon. Somehow it had never occurred to me before that all those rocks collected by the astronauts were available for research, or that one could make a career out of studying extraterrestrial materials. I ended up doing a senior thesis with Basu on the Apollo 16 regolith samples and decided that I wanted to pursue space sciences in graduate school.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By this time I was married and had just given birth to my second child, so I was looking for a school with some flexibility that could accommodate a student who also had a family to raise. Washington University (WUSTL) was recommended by Dave and Marilyn Lindstrom and, indeed, my visit to the campus and especially to the \"4th floor\" -- which at the time seemed to have more canine than human inhabitants -- confirmed for me that this was the place for me. To her credit, my future advisor, Dr. Ghislaine Crozaz, never expressed the slightest doubt that I could handle the demands of family and graduate school.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is a Research Professor in Cosmochemistry? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I am a research professor of cosmochemistry at Washington University in St. Louis (WUSTL).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The freedom to pursue my own research interests is one of the great aspects about working in academia. Since I don't have any teaching duties, I have a lot of freedom to choose what I work on and how I spend my days. Over the years much of my work has involved the study of achondrites and chondrites, how they originated and what they can tell us about the origin of the solar system. More recently, my research has focused on the study of presolar grains and what we can learn from them about the formation and evolution of the stars and our galaxy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the best aspects of working at WUSTL is the interdisciplinary nature of the McDonnell Center for the Space Sciences. The \"Mac Center\" consists of scientists from both the physics department and the department of Earth and planetary sciences, as well as colleagues from chemistry and engineering. The opportunity to interact closely with members from different departments is important in the space sciences, where the problems that we address typically span traditional scientific disciplines. For example, my current work on presolar silicate grains involves as much mineralogy (using compositional and structural information to understand the grain formation in circumstellar outflows) as it does astrophysics (using isotopic data to constrain stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>One of my favorite career moments came after my husband (who was also a work colleague) and I had spent an inordinate amount of time trying to measure the iron isotopic composition of a particular grain, which we had identified as presolar (based on earlier oxygen isotopic measurements).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Iron isotopic measurements of presolar grains are difficult for a number of reasons, not least of which is simply trying to locate the grain you are trying to measure due to the poor quality of the imaging system on the instrument. After an entire week of simply trying to find that one grain, we finally decided to simply measure every grain in the vicinity. Over the weekend, we worked on processing the data: my husband took our daughter to her Saturday morning swim practice and, while there, compared the coordinates of our measurements with the ones from the oxygen isotopic measurements. At the same time, I stayed at home and analyzed the isotopic data. One grain clearly had a significantly different isotopic composition from all the others. When my husband came home, we compared our data sets and found that the grain I had identified as isotopically anomalous was, in fact, the same one that he had targeted as the presolar grain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other work colleagues whom I have told this story to have been less impressed, (\"well, yes sure\") but to me it was a beautiful validation of the scientific process after a very frustrating week, made more meaningful by the familial context in which it was obtained.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My advisor, Professor Ghislaine Crozaz, has been an inspiration not only in terms of setting a high standard for research, but also for her compassion and caring towards others. She has been a friend throughout my career and has always been someone I can turn to for advice, both personal and professional. As a woman pursuing a career in a male-dominated field, she has also been an excellent role model for me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another source of inspiration has been Professor Tom Bernatowicz, the current head of our \"4th floor\" group. I have always admired his scientific rigor and his whole-hearted pursuit of scientific knowledge for its own sake. I am also inspired by his dedication to the students he teaches.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It's a clich&eacute;, but I can only say: find something that you love to do. And don't be afraid to follow a non-traditional path; there are many definitions of success and in the end it doesn't matter if your route is more convoluted than the norm or if it takes you longer to get there.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I like to travel. I enjoy hiking and other outdoor activities such as biking, camping, etc. I'm a big reader (as you would expect from someone who once wanted to be a librarian), on topics ranging from history to biography to science fiction and literature. There are so many fascinating things to learn about the world that I can't imagine ever getting bored, even if I were to quit science and completely devote myself to other topics.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Explore your opportunities. Try to get involved in research as an undergraduate student. This will give you an understanding of whether research, and the academic life, are right for you. There is a lot of freedom in academia, but also a lot of personal responsibility. What you accomplish is largely determined by the amount of effort you are willing to put into it; that's true of most fields of course, not just the STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) areas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>This profile has been adapted in part from an original interview conducted by Susan Niebur, for the \"Women in Planetary Science\" website.

Heinlein and Frank Herbert -- to name a few.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is a NASA Project Manager?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Simply put, a NASA Project Manager is the person entrusted to lead and manage the execution of a spaceflight project for NASA. For missions (such as the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter [LRO]) done in-house at NASA, project managing entails leading and inspiring an incredibly talented cadre of NASA people, while trying to balance the often competing goals of perfect technical performance with cost and schedule constraints.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career. </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A favorite moment was when the LRO spacecraft separated from the Atlas V rocket and deployed its solar arrays to begin the trip to the moon under her own power.

Each project or assignment will bring a wealth of opportunities to learn and master new science and technology. (Particularly important to being a NASA project manager is to keep learning about technology so that you are properly technically literate.) And you must develop perseverance. Having it and inspiring it in others is the single most important key to achieving success in any challenging endeavor.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, working at NASA <i>is</i> fun, and some days I am amazed they pay me to do it!

Even though all these groups are working toward the same goal, like driving a rover on Mars, finding the right balance among all the groups is difficult.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A Program Scientist helps two of those groups, the mission team and NASA Headquarters, work well together. A Program Scientist is the team's representative at NASA Headquarters and is also the Headquarters' representative to the team; that sounds weird because it's an odd job. But what it means is that I explain the mission, its successes, and its failures to the managers at Headquarters, and at the same time I explain NASA Headquarters to the team.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>For sheer adrenaline it was hard to beat sitting in the control room at the <a href='http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/' target='_blank'>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</a> (JPL) and watching Spirit and Opportunity land on Mars. It was also amazing to see the first radar data come in after Cassini's first flyby of Titan (that was particularly memorable because I was up in the middle of the night with my son, who was only a few months old, and we watched the data come in together).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Figure out what you love to do and then find the jobs that allow you to do it.

But as a kid I definitely dreamed of working for NASA and exploring the planets.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I like to spend as much time as I can with my family -- everything is fun when you do it with your kids!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Education is critical, there is no substitute for hard work, and you need to ask for help when needed! In one of my classes in college my grades quickly plummeted as I got more and more confused. This was a really embarrassing situation for me. I swallowed my pride and admitted to the professor that I was completely lost, and he and I worked hard to improve my understanding of the material until my grades improved. I still remember bumping into him after the semester ended and thanking him for the grade he gave me. He stopped, looked straight into my eyes, and said, \"I didn't 'give' you that grade, you <i>earned</i> it.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><b>Read More</b><br />\r\n*<a href='http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/index.cfm' target='_blank'>Cassini Mission to Saturn</a><br />\r\n*<a href='http://opfm.jpl.nasa.gov/' target='_blank'>Our Planets Flagship Mission Website</a><br />\r\n*<a href='http://marsrover.nasa.gov/home/' target='_blank'>Mars Exploration Rovers Homepage</a></p>\r\n",

My first really meaningful, heartfelt space moment came when I got to see a shuttle launch from Cape Canaveral. I can still remember the feel of the thunderous roar and the very surprising high-pitched crackling sound as the rockets tore through the atmosphere. I remember feeling a deep sense of pride, not just as an American, but pride in what we humans can accomplish with focus and purpose. It took my breath away.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin clearfix'></div>\n<div class='quote'>\n\"I view project management<br />\r\nas helping a group of capable<br />\r\npeople get something<br />\r\nmeaningful accomplished.\"\n</div>\n<footer>\n<cite>- Daniel Andrews in front of a display that reads 'NASA Explores New Worlds To Improve Our Own.</cite>\n</footer>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin'></div>\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>How did you end up working in the space program?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>While I was getting my bachelor's degree in electrical engineering, I was approached by one of my professors, who had been visited by a former student who was working at <a href='http://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/home/index.html' target='_blank'>NASA-Ames Research Center</a> (ARC). The professor explained to me that there was an opportunity at NASA for a controls/automation engineer and he recommended me for the job. I followed through with an interview and was offered an engineering position. The decision didn't require much pondering and I have never regretted it.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>At an early age my dad, a physicist and tech hobbyist, got me interested in building and later programming. We would build various electronic kits and even a Sinclair computer where I got my first taste of programming. He helped me imagine all the things you could do with a computer. I found myself rushing through school work in order to try making objects appear on the computer screen. Once I mastered that I moved groups of objects. One thing led to another and I had programmed a home version of the arcade game, \"Space Invaders.\" It also led me to conclude that I would need more horsepower from the machine ... a realization I would have over and over again in life. One thing led to another and I was wondering how this computer could control objects in the physical world. Soon I was imagining primitive robotics applications. I would later create automatic vertical blinds controllers, which enabled the blinds to track the sun and all kinds of car gadgets. On and on it went with devices, contraptions and open-ended imagination all inspired by those early days watching and learning from my dad.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is a Project Manager?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The role of a project manager (PM) is similar to that of an orchestra conductor. A conductor does not play an instrument; instead his job is to look ahead on the sheet music and guide the musicians. The PM's sheet music is his project plan and he needs to make sure everyone is on the same page, while listening for necessary adjustments. He is always looking out for the best interest of the symphony and its performance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I came to project management as an experienced engineer who had worked on teams many times before. Before I became a project manager I noticed that the people I enjoyed working for the most were the ones who allowed me ownership of my work and who cleared away obstacles so that I could do my job. This is what I consider to be true leadership. I did not have to always agree with the direction the leader was going, but I wanted to know my opinion was heard. I also needed to know someone had their hand on the steering wheel and would be decisive. This experience evolved my view of the type of project manager I should be: I view project management as helping a group of capable people get something meaningful accomplished. Some project managers take pride in being in front of the group, but I have a far more pragmatic view of it. All members of a project team have a role, including the project manager. All of us together are moving toward an end goal.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career.</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Sitting in Mission Control at Cape Canaveral and sending the Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite (LCROSS) on its way to the Moon ranks pretty high as a favorite moment for me. But just as meaningful as the technical accomplishments are, I took great pride in watching the team enjoy their success and getting their much deserved appreciation at the team's \"Family Appreciation\" event. The event, hosted by NASA-ARC senior management, was about as good as it gets. The center director, deputy center director and the executive management team made speeches of appreciation to the family members of the LCROSS team who were present. All the family members were given special tours and special treatment for the evening. It was a moment of great pride to see all the people whose spouses/parents who had been working long hours on the LCROSS mission be given special thanks.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It helps to have an engineering background to aid you with your decision making as a technical project manager, but not every engineer fits the project manager role. The key is to try project management on a smaller scale by leading smaller teams, working on relatively short projects and see if you find it rewarding to step back from doing technical work and organize a team toward a common goal. This will also give you the chance to improve/grow your project management skills.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I enjoy hiking, biking and jogging. Our family makes a regular trek to Lake Tahoe in the summer to do miles of hiking on the granite. We take local hikes in the hills of northern California as well. Life balance is not always easy and sometimes you have to \"move out of balance\" for a while, but it is important to always to look to where you want to be and to actively steer in that direction.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Broaden your technical knowledge. It will serve you later in ways you may not yet realize.</p>\r\n",

My father was a part of the team that built the Apollo lunar landers. Our family watched the landings with pride, knowing that he had a hand in their construction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, it was not until many years later, at the age of 21, when Roger Burns at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) handed me a lunar sample that I was hooked. I rapidly abandoned my plans to be a field geologist, and decided to become a geochemist and study planetary materials.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><blockquote>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin clearfix'></div>\n<div class='quote'>\n\"Cultivate and prioritize having hobbies and a life outside your profession that includes things you do to take care of yourself and others.\"\n</div>\n<footer>\n<cite>- Darby Dyar</cite>\n</footer>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin'></div>\n</blockquote></span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>How did you end up working in the space program?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I grew up in the 1960s, at a time when you only had to take a single science course to graduate from high school. I therefore took biology in ninth grade -- I then thought that I was done with science for life!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, out of sheer stubbornness, I persevered in math and took calculus as a senior. The boys laughed at me every time I put my hand up in class, but my teacher helped me find a voice. I learned a lot from that experience about survival skills in an all-male class, which came in handy later on. The first time I saw a woman scientist was when I was 19 years old, so I never imagined science as a career option for me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I attended Wellesley College, which is an all-women liberal arts college, where I decided to major in art history. During my sophomore year, my advisor gently reminded me that I needed to fulfill a science course. I asked around to find out which one was the easiest, and reluctantly enrolled in Geology 101. The first day of class I slunk into the lecture hall and planted myself in the back row with a disinterested expression. My expression rapidly changed when a woman walked in and gave a knock-your-eyes-out great lecture full of slides of cool geology with succinct explanations. (That professor, Meg Thompson, eventually became a good friend and an inspiration.) So I took another geology course, and another, and ended up with a double-major.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My life as a planetary scientist began in the middle of my senior year when I was looking for a job to bring in a little extra money. One of my Wellesley professors directed me to Roger Burns at MIT, who was looking for someone who could do lab work (on lunar samples!) and computer programming. This went so well that Roger talked me into applying to MIT for graduate school and NASA supplied the funding for a cool Ph.D. project involving cooling rates of lunar glasses, so I became a geochemist instead of an art historian!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Meg Thompson inspired me; she was my first and best-ever geology professor. I also had other wonderful mentors at Wellesley College, including my art professors who encouraged me to pursue both an avocation and a profession. I was closely supported by Roger Burns and Charles Guidotti, both dear friends and great sources of support -- and both lost too soon to cancer. George Rossman (at Caltech) is always there for me to give scientific advice. Jerry Delaney of Rutgers University has been a long-term source of support.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have often wished for more women mentors as I've progressed through my career but they are few and far between. My generation of women scientists has had to make it up as we go along! Perhaps the fact that I had so little help is what inspired me to mentor and help improve the lot of others.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is a Professor of Astronomy?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Mount Holyoke College, which is an all-women liberal arts college, is a wonderful place for me. My job here is explicitly about education, and doing research is a way to serve that mission by informing and inspiring my teaching. It is wonderful to be training the next generation of scientifically-literate individuals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before Holyoke, I was a professor of geology at the University of Oregon in Eugene. When I started teaching there in 1986, the chair explained to me that my emphasis should be on research, grant-writing and graduate education; teaching and undergraduate students were to be lower on my scale of priorities. I was never very comfortable with that situation. One of my students once looked at my 16-hours-a-day, seven-days-a-week life as a scientist and said, \"Darby, I respect you, but I really don't want to be like you.\" This really shook me up, and I resolved to make some changes in my life. So I'm very grateful for the balance and flexibility that being at Mount Holyoke brings to my life and to my career.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career.</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The last time I taught mineralogy was in 2006. I taught it as a studio course: two three-hour sessions each week in the laboratory. I used my own textbook and a new pedagogy (for me) called \"spiral learning\" for the class. There was something special about the synergy in that class and those 11 extraordinary women, who have all gone on to graduate school in various professions. A few years later, they came back for a reunion, and we gathered in my lab for a celebration. We all re-connected instantly. That was the moment when I realized that my students will be my most important legacy, far outshining my hundreds of scientific publications.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If you want to study the solar system, build your work in planetary science on a firm foundation of terrestrial geology and/or extrasolar astronomy. If you want a job in academia, this is a necessity for finding and keeping a job. Diversify your funding sources among NASA, the Research Corporation for Science Advancement (RCSA), the Department of Energy (DOE), and the National Science Foundation (NSF).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Training yourself to be an expert in a single technique can be risky because it can lead to becoming a one-trick pony. Try not to overspecialize. It's far better to build a reputation as someone who asks interesting scientific questions and then teaches herself the techniques needed to answer those questions in creative, original and integrative ways.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You're never too young to spend time mentoring others to help them become scientists. These gestures will end up coming back to you in unexpected and wonderful ways.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Be a good scientific citizen. For every paper you submit, agree to review two others. For every proposal, review four. Organize a conference (once in your career). Become an associate editor for a journal, and serve until you've handled more papers than you think you'll ever write. Lead a committee in your professional society. Serve on review panels when asked (and when possible). Learn from all these experiences! Do all these things at times in your career when your other commitments are fewer, so that when life gets busier, you'll still feel that you've done your share.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you're passionate about science, then you'll need to resist the temptation to do it 24 hours a day! To stay sane, become (if you aren't already) a well-rounded human being, with authentic and supportive relationships with family and friends. Cultivate and prioritize having hobbies and a life outside your profession that includes things you do to take care of yourself and others. Of all the things I learned from working with Roger Burns, this lesson was the most important.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another thing I learned from Roger Burns: treat everyone the same. Although he was a senior professor at MIT, Roger interacted with everyone from the janitor, to his students, to his colleagues with respect, caring and humility. He was always a gentleman, and he had high standards for professionalism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Persistence matters. I was 44 years old when I finally got tenure (after teaching for 17 years).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Never collaborate with people you don't like, or who can't accept you for what you are.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It's OK to put priorities relating to your personal life ahead of those of your professional life -- as long as you realize that there will be consequences (sometimes heartbreaking ones!). The hardest thing I ever did was quit my job on the verge of tenure to relocate 300 miles away so I could live full-time in the same town as my husband and kids (then aged one and three years old). But it was an easy and obvious decision that I will never regret.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When it comes to balancing all the competing demands of a busy life, someone once told me to \"throw money at the problem.\" I know a woman who not only pays someone to clean her house, but also hires a cook to come three days a week to make dinner so she can spend time with her kids in those critical few hours after daycare ends. Hire a student to drive carpools for you when possible. Your sanity is worth the financial cost.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Learn to be flexible and always be prepared. Adapt your career to your situation in life, and manage your work time wisely so as to maximize your family time. Save up some extra data when you're pregnant so you'll have something to write up after your baby is born. Deliver your kids to daycare the minute it opens, and pick them up at closing time so you can get the most work done while they are otherwise happily engaged, and can then devote time to them exclusively when you are home. Always have with you a paper or proposal to review while you're waiting in line to pick up your kids. Set aside a less-urgent project to do on the days when you're home with a sick child. Do your grading at the kitchen table next to your kids while they are doing their homework (misery loves company!). Bring your laptop so you can work while your elderly parents doze in the nursing home and still be there when they wake up again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, accept the fact that you really can't do it all to perfection. This isn't easy. Decide what's most important in your life, and set your priorities to reflect those decisions. There are many times when my life is simply out of control, but I've learned to have faith in the way I've ordered my priorities and just stick to working down my list, starting with what's most important. Learn when to strive for perfection and when an 80% effort is good enough.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Plan for chaos: don't let things like abstracts, proposal reviews or presentations wait until the last minute, because that invites disaster. Pay a little more and buy refundable/changeable plane tickets (or fly Southwest!). Always have a back-up plan.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I enjoy spending time with my own children, my extended family and my friends. Just hanging out or cooking together is a great way to get together. Having breakfast or going shopping with my two women geologist friends is always fun. I love walking my dog and being outside every single day. Some of my hobbies include riding my bike around the beautiful valley where I live, tending my garden and my bird feeders, making art quilts, and reading mystery novels.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Think about science and engineering as broadly as possible. The world needs educated citizens who support science in many ways -- journalism, law, business, etc. Seek out ways to become scientifically and quantitatively literate, and apply that knowledge to whatever your chosen field becomes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you're really a person who lives and breathes science, then take as much science as you can in high school -- this will boost your success in introductory classes at the college level, which will open doors. Try to get practical experience as soon as possible -- look for internships while in high school, and definitely during your summers in college.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>This profile has been adapted in part from an original interview conducted by Susan Niebur, for the \"Women in Planetary Science\" website.

Today, I live in the canyons behind the <a href='http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/' target='_blank'>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</a> (JPL) in Altadena, Calif.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Describe the first time you made a personal connection with outer space. </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I can still remember my first view of Saturn with those amazing rings, and of banded Jupiter -- whose moons were lined up differently every night -- in a 4-inch reflector when I was 7 years old.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><div class='image_module right' style='width: Color image of old newspaper.px;'>\n<figure class='inline_figure'>\n<img alt='' src='/images/content/Doody_Inset.jpg'>\n</figure>\n</div></span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>How did you end up working in the space program? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>When I applied to work for JPL I insisted that my experience in flight operations (albeit with airplanes), and my experience with those newfangled microcomputers made me a good candidate. They believed me, so I went to work first with the Deep Space Network (DSN), and then I became a member of the Voyager flight team, as my first space project.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is a Realtime Flight Operations Lead Engineer? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\"Realtime\" means as close as you can get, given the speed of light, to dealing directly with the spacecraft.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"Flight Operations\" means working closely with the Deep Space Network to send commands to the spacecraft, and navigational signals to and from the spacecraft; it means running programs that check engineering telemetry (distant measurements) to be sure the spacecraft's systems are all operating within their limits. Also, it means making sure the teams of scientists are receiving their data (whether it's the images and other telemetry from instruments aboard the craft, or the pure radio tones from radio science experiments, such as flying behind Saturn's rings and atmosphere to probe them directly with radio).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"Lead Engineer\" means I manage to have all the plans, procedures and communications working smoothly, so the rest of the flight team can depend on us.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career. </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A favorite recollection is when my team members and I watched images building up line-by-line on the monitors from Voyager 2's very remote \"eyes.\" We were in touch with the craft as it dove over Neptune's cold northern cloud decks and flew through a gravitational corridor that would take it close by the big, retrograde, captured moon Triton. Later, thanks to newly programmed image-motion compensation running perfectly aboard the spacecraft, clear images revealed a cold alien landscape where later analysis revealed active nitrogen geysers issuing from beneath Triton's nitrogen-snowy surface. This was Voyager 2's last encounter. It was on a hyperbolic trajectory, leaving the Sun behind forever. And Carl Sagan, one of the imaging-team scientists, threw the whole flight team a party. Chuck Berry was rocking and duck-walking his electric guitar across the wide concrete steps out in front of JPL's administration building. What a way to leave the solar system!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I have been inspired in person by my father, an electrical engineer and patent lawyer. I have been inspired by the books and/or public appearances of Richard Feynman, Isaac Asimov, Carl Sagan, Richard Dawkins, and Timothy Ferris.

My teachers there gave me an opportunity to push beyond the standard curricula in science, math, economics, and government.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Describe the first time you made a personal connection with outer space.</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As a child, I was spell-bound by the Apollo astronauts as they began to explore the Moon. Their work inspired me so much. I look forward to a time when humans once again explore the Moon and beyond, because we need those types of events to inspire a new generation of students.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin clearfix'></div>\n<div class='quote'>\n\"When we explore space, we are not leaving Earth behind; rather, we are also discovering more about ourselves and our home planet.\"\n</div>\n<footer>\n<cite>- David Kring</cite>\n</footer>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin'></div>\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>How did you end up working in the space program?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As an undergraduate student at Indiana University, I was given an opportunity to study Apollo samples from the Moon. This later led to Ph.D.-level studies at Harvard University. From there, I went to the University of Arizona where I spent nearly 17 years conducting NASA-sponsored research, as well as teaching students of my own. The experience I developed with samples from the Moon, Mars and asteroids has led to my current opportunity to help the nation develop a robotic and human exploration program that will carry us back to the Moon, and beyond.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is a Senior Staff Scientist/Principal Investigator?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As a senior staff scientist, I conduct basic scientific research of the planets, including contributions to NASA's Cosmochemistry Program, Planetary Geology and Geophysics Program, and Mars Fundamental Research Program. For example, as part of the Cosmochemistry Program, my team discovered a collision between two asteroids that occurred before the Earth's Moon had even formed. Projects like this help us to build a picture of the formation of our solar system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As part of the Mars Fundamental Research Program, my team used analyses of impact craters on <a href='PLANET:Earth' target='_blank'>Earth</a> to predict that impact events on ancient Mars produced vast subsurface hydrothermal systems. This prediction has since been confirmed with spacecraft detection of mineralogical signatures of those systems. Since we know that life can evolve in these types of systems, they will be the focus of future exploration on Mars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As principal investigator for the Center for Lunar Science and Exploration, I am responsible for a team of about 50 scientists who are exploring the origin and evolution of the Moon and its implications for the origin and evolution of the Earth. The team is also integrating scientific and exploration objectives with the development of hardware, tools and operational protocols that will be needed to explore the Moon and other planetary surfaces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I also lead several training programs for undergraduate and graduate students, including work at Meteor Crater in Arizona, which is one of the world's most spectacular impact sites. I am also responsible for an education and public outreach program that is designed to inspire and help interested students develop career paths that enhance the scientific and technological capabilities of our nation.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career.</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the most extraordinary moments in my life was when our team discovered the Chicxulub impact crater and linked it to the extinction of the dinosaurs. That impact event caused a global calamity and demonstrated that impacting asteroids and comets can alter both the geologic and biologic evolution of a planet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is also important to point out that the discovery of the Chicxulub crater is an incredibly important outcome of space exploration. Specifically, the lessons I learned while studying impact events on the Moon set the stage for the discovery of Chicxulub. That linkage underscores a truism that is often forgotten: When we explore space, we are not leaving Earth behind; rather, we are also discovering more about ourselves and our home planet.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As noted above, the Apollo astronauts obviously inspired me. However, I have been shaped by dozens of people: family, neighbors, teachers, and government leaders. Collectively, they promoted an expectation and created a series of opportunities for me to successfully contribute to our nation's future.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Embrace the challenges your teachers give you and let your curiosity carry you to new places. Respect the guidance given you and be thankful for each opportunity. And, when you have succeeded, remember to turn to the next generation and help them achieve an even higher level of success.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I am a planetary geologist whose first fascination is with his own planet Earth. I spend countless hours hiking through canyons, over mountains and across deserts, absorbing the wonder of it all and probing curiously those terrains to learn more about them.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There are elements of science, math and engineering that are simply fun. However, while you are developing the tools to become a professional, you will certainly bump into some challenging walls. You need to find the strength to persevere, because once you have mastered those capabilities, the world, indeed the Universe, will lie open to you and your exploration of it.</p>\r\n",

What I like about it is that it has great weather, a lot of outdoor activities and it is culturally diverse.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Describe the first time you made a personal connection with outer space. </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I have two. I remember as a child sitting in the back seat during a long drive with my family and watching the Moon outside the car window. I noticed that, even with all the turns we made or even if we drove straight, the moon didn't move, grow or change. It suddenly occurred to me that the moon was really big and very far away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What really turned me on to astronomy was my first astronomy class in college. I didn't need to take this class. (I had actually already finished all of my science requirements.) However, my friend persuaded me to take the course with her. She eventually dropped it, but I kept going because I found it fun and so interesting. I loved it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><blockquote>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin clearfix'></div>\n<div class='quote'>\n\"If you are passionate about science and math or engineering, then you should absolutely pursue them, because these subjects are perfect passion fields.\"\n</div>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin'></div>\n</blockquote></span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>How did you end up working in the space program? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>When I earned my undergraduate degree in physics with a concentration in astrophysics, I had an opportunity to work at NASA's <a href='http://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/home/index.html' target='_blank'>Ames Research Center</a> (ARC) as a contractor in the Earth Science department. It was interesting science, and I learned a lot! Later, I became a civil servant for NASA in the computer science division. I am now working as a computer scientist at ARC.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Several teachers and advisors inspired me in college. One college professor in particular is Dr. Adrienne Cool. Dr. Cool is an astrophysicist and has been one of my role models for years. She didn't view science as a difficult problem to somehow overcome, but instead looked at it as a fun challenge. I really liked that perspective, and she helped me learn how to do research, which is different than studying books about science. It's also much more fun.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is a Computer Engineer? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Being a computer engineer can mean many things. For me personally, it means that I lead and manage research and software development teams; making decisions about which direction we should go regarding resolving a <i>problem.</i> The DASHlink collaborative website is a good example. We developed DASHlink to connect NASA researchers and the broader data mining and systems health community in order to easily share research and data. I am currently starting a research development project dealing with modularized satellites.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career. </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There are so many! One particularly memorable moment was when we had been developing technology for a virtual environment to train astronauts. We were working with the Johnson Space Center (JSC) in Houston, Texas and had a chance to present our work to some really high level people. We were convinced that we had just developed it enough to present and impress our audience. The meeting went unbelievably well. It was fantastic!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My second favorite moment may come as a surprise because it has to do with the Columbia Space Shuttle disaster. I woke up, saw the news and was devastated. I had been here at Ames when we had lost a robotic Mars mission, and people were so upset then. I thought that it would be infinitely worse since this tragedy involved people that we knew and cared for personally. When I returned to work on Monday morning, it was not at all depressing -- it was inspiring. Everyone wanted to be of use, they wanted to contribute, and they wanted to make a difference. It was very moving to see people coming together with similar goals: How can we find out what happened? How can we find out how to fix it? And how can we find out how to prevent it in the future?</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Do internships at NASA, or elsewhere if you prefer, each and every summer. I see such value in this. When high school students graduate they are so often asked what they are going to do when they <i>grow up,</i> and they believe that they have to have an answer to that question. But really, in order to know you must see the day-to-day world of a career and sample it first; that way you can make a wise decision in picking your career. Internships give you that day-to-day. And you don't have to intern just for science and engineering companies. Internships in all fields will give you perspective and skills needed for any job.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlso, check out the college you think you want to attend and make sure it is a good fit. The school that was best for me was one where I could be considered a peer in the classroom. For me this meant that it would be alright for me to ask a lot of questions. This tended to be smaller classrooms. I took classes at Stanford, and it wasn't quite a good fit, for many reasons, one being that it was a competitive, rather than a collaborative environment. So pick your school carefully.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I mountain bike -- biking the trails of the Santa Cruz mountains is a favorite. I love to travel. I am hoping to go to Alaska next! I read both non-fiction and fiction books. I just finished \"For the Win\" (Cory Doctorow) -- a fascinating fictional book about the global community of gamers. And I'm in a classics phase; my two most recent classic reads are \"Art of War\" (Sun Tzu) and \"The Invisible Man\" (Herbert George Wells). And I like to eat. I like to try new foods and new restaurants!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Yay! I am so glad you are studying these subjects. Stick with it! If you are passionate about science and math or engineering, then you should absolutely pursue them, because these subjects are perfect passion fields. If you find them challenging and difficult don't give up. Science and math or engineering subjects are supposed to be challenging and difficult. And there are many options for careers by knowing these skills. There are more options for you than just wearing a lab coat or becoming a professor.</p>\r\n",

I went to Turner and Moten elementary schools and Hart Junior High School in southeast D.C., and Ballou Senior High School. I went to the University of the District of Columbia. My major was business and public management. I have also taken several classes at the Graduate School USA, including leadership, training, government correspondence, and in-house training.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Describe the first time you made a personal connection with outer space.</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I was in American History Class in High School 11th grade. It was Career Day. They talked about different careers and opportunities that the students can go into, and they mentioned NASA. That sparked my interest, especially since I used to pass by it a lot. I used to come to the National Mall (a national park in downtown Washington, D.C.) a lot and go to the museums there. I became fascinated with NASA.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin clearfix'></div>\n<div class='quote'>\n\"My advice is to keep an open mind, take training (never stop learning), and whatever your job is, do your best.\"\n</div>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin'></div>\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>How did you end up working in the space program?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As a kid I dreamed of working for NASA. I would pass by NASA Headquarters on Maryland Avenue SW in Washington, D.C., on my daily commute to work. After passing by NASA Headquarters for 1 year, I decided then that I was going to seek employment at NASA. I applied for a job at NASA Headquarters and was hired within a month as a contractor employee clerk typist. The following year I applied for another position in the Federal Government, in civil service as a secretary.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What does your job entail?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I am a program planning specialist. I do mission support for our programs in the Planetary Science Division, in NASA&rsquo;s Science Mission Directorate (SMD). I do events planning and guest operations for all of SMD. That means at the launches of satellites, I make sure the guests have the best experience they can have. I conduct tours for very, very important people (VVIPs) such as heads of agencies, guests of the NASA Administrator, and also for very important people (VIP), which are members of the public.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I also perform public outreach for all of SMD. That includes dissemination of information about NASA programs and missions. I send materials to schools and educators. For instance, I worked on the U.S. Science and Engineering Festival. I demonstrated the new ROVE-E, a prototype of Curiosity that shows how the rover roves over the Martian terrain. It can collect samples and send back pictures. The Curiosity rover on Mars does experiments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Less than two weeks ago I was over at Union Station doing outreach. I worked during the Earth Day (April 22, 2016) event at the National Mall. They had a knowledge tree, and I collected people&rsquo;s thoughts about the Earth and how the environment has changed for the good, or sometimes not so good, and how we can make sustainable energy. I collected attendees&rsquo; thoughts about what we can do to preserve Earth for future generations.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career.</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2012 I accepted a detail position in NASA&rsquo;s Planetary Science Division at NASA Headquarters. I made a career change from an executive assistant to a program support role, and changed from a clerical series to a professional series.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have gained a lot of personal satisfaction. I knew that I could do much more than push papers, and I wanted to give back to NASA and to my community. I know that when I go to the different schools, and when the kids (African American kids) see folks that look like them, it inspires them to go into different careers at NASA. They think that everyone who works for NASA is a scientist, astronaut or engineer, but there are so many careers that you can go into.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NASA seems to attract the best and the brightest; that is why I always wanted to work for NASA. When you see the looks in kids&rsquo; eyes when I say I work for NASA, they just get so excited.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My mother, who always told me that I could do and be anything that I wanted, if I just apply myself and stay focused. No matter what you do, do your best. She always told me to stay in school and never stop learning.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My advice is to keep an open mind, take training (never stop learning), and whatever your job is do your best.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I love to listen to jazz and dance. I visit parks frequently for nature walks. I am intrigued with the constant changing of the environment &ndash; the variety of living things to see, the smells, and the sounds I hear all are relaxing to me, and every visit is an adventure.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Study hard and stay focused so that you can do well in school. Choose a subject that you enjoy, for it can lead to a rewarding career. I now have my dream job. I have fun at work and, moreover, I really enjoy my job. NASA is an awesome place to work.</p>\r\n",

I used the curriculum from the JASON Project founded by Dr. Robert Ballard, discoverer of the wreck of the Titanic. Several JASON teachers were selected to speak with the principal investigator of the Stardust program, Dr. Don Brownlee. I then found out that the <a href='http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/' target='_blank'>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</a> (JPL) was looking for Stardust Educators, so I applied. After being accepted, the program was broadened to include other NASA missions and I became a solar system educator. Just in the past few years I have been writing curriculum for teachers to use with comet missions, as well as showing teachers how to use this curriculum with their students.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My fifth grade teacher was my inspiration. As we worked on our spelling or math lessons my teacher would push a tall cart into our room with a big boxy black and white TV perched on top, which was tuned to the Apollo rocket launches that were going to the moon! I was so grateful to have a teacher who wanted us to see these live events. That was the year I decided that I wanted to help others learn too. What I really wanted to be was the kind of teacher who helps kids experience and witness science as my fifth grade teacher did for me!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is a Teacher/Observatory Coordinator? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I have witnessed Space Shuttle and other launches from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.

As coordinator of the observatory -- a rarity in a middle school -- I am in charge of a rotating domed structure and the 14-inch reflecting Meade Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope within, as well as its classroom. I also direct programs at the observatory, which include not only instruction for Jackson Middle School kids, but instruction and viewing for community groups as well. The most exciting thing for me is when an observatory experience lights a fire in one of the students. My thrill is when I see these students realizing their potential through observations or an experience with a NASA mission. To me, that's my rocket launch.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career.</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to be a hands-on, exciting teacher I try to be involved with science myself. This has led me to exciting dinosaur digs, flying over active volcanoes, walking on fresh lava and through lava tube caves, and even snorkeling with a giant sea turtle! I have been to mountain tops to witness the rings of Saturn through giant telescopes, and donned a white clean room suit to hold a moon rock and a meteorite.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I watched scientists remove the first sample of comet dust from the Stardust sample return capsule. I watched in awe as a test rover spun around the testing area, and I was there at the base of the Deep Space Network antenna as data came in from the Stardust spacecraft 250 million miles away. I've been to the base of the NASA rocket launch pads and stood on top of the rocket engine test towers. I even watched an astronaut teacher launch into space on the Space Shuttle. I have done all of this, and more, just to bring these experiences back to students and make education exciting for them.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to be a good teacher be inspired yourself. Be a student and involved in learning right along with those whom you are teaching. I have not left my students behind. My students have traveled with me to NASA facilities and fossil dig sites. We've watched the northern lights, meteor showers, transits, launches and landings. And the best part about my job is that I get to keep learning and be inspired with my students.</p>\r\n",

Breathe. Do Science. Sleep later.\"\n</div>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin'></div>\n</blockquote></span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>How did you end up working in the space program?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I actually always knew I would work in either astronomy or space sciences. This was the only career path ever on my list of career possibilities. I was hired by The Franklin Institute to work in the observatory as a rising junior in college. That turned into full-time employment when I graduated, and I've had great work and educational experiences ever since.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As a kid, I didn't know any scientists. Oh sure, I'd read about all kinds of scientists, so while it didn't immediately come to mind as a typical career choice for a young black kid in an inner-city neighborhood, I also knew it wasn't completely ridiculous either. There was just no guidance for a kid with such aspirations. I suppose I was inspired to pursue science by an eighth grade science teacher I had, but astronomy intrigued me. It was exotic, complicated and multi-faceted. It was also very exciting because for the first 17 years of my life, the greatest scientific endeavor ever, putting people on the Moon, hit a new milestone every year. The work of astronomers, who sought to understand the nature of the expansion of the universe, like Maarten Schmidt and Alan Sandage, was inspirational.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is a Chief Astronomer and Planetarium Programs Director?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Working with many others here, I develop and oversee all of Franklin's astronomy and space science-related programs and exhibits and run the observatory. I also create programs for the planetarium, frequently do the live \"Sky Tonight\" planetarium show, teach astronomy workshops, and do a bit of science interpretation and advocacy work on television with my friends Keith Olbermann, Stephen Colbert and Craig Ferguson. Occasionally there's a \"kitchen sink\" job to do like identifying (non)meteorites for visitors or taking a call from someone who is positive the UFO they've seen is actually an alien spacecraft, but it's been everything from hosting Clyde Tombaugh to helping President Obama's family look through a telescope on the White House lawn.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career. </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>What, you mean like the time I got to see the Hubble Space Telescope in the clean room at Lockheed in Sunnyvale before its launch, or when I got to host Sir Martin Rees when he was here at Franklin to receive the Franklin Medal or when I got to meet and interview John Glenn or when I traveled with Scott Carpenter on vacation last year or when I used to go to shuttle launches as the invited guest of astronauts or when I gave Michael Jackson a private tour of our observatory or when I met and interviewed Carl Sagan or when I was given \"command\" of the Cunard Lines ship \"Vistafjord\" on the Black Sea as lead astronomer for the 1999 solar eclipse or after I successfully rebuilt the Franklin's 24-inch reflector and it actually worked better or when I completed the training to fly as a Virgin Galactic sub-orbital passenger?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No, my favorite was as I sat waiting for a train home after work one day about eight years ago. A young man came over, seemingly out of nowhere, and said, \"Mr. Pitts, you don't know me but I've watched you since I was a kid and your work inspired me to become a scientist, and I love it. Thanks!\" and he walked off into the crowd. My other favorite moments are when I help people see an object through a telescope for the first time. For me, nothing beats seeing the <i>light bulb</i> come on!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Be creative, be flexible and most of all, be prepared and able to communicate. Realize that while there may not be very many positions in astronomy research, there are lots of other equally satisfying possibilities in related fields and more importantly, we desperately need people who can teach science.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I do SCIENCE! No, seriously, I travel and explore for fun. It's a fascinating world and I can't get enough of it. But I'm always doing \"science\" of some kind no matter where I am. I love it -- can't escape it and wouldn't want to. Eat. Breathe. Do Science. Sleep later.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Find people -- lots of people -- doing what you think you're interested in and spend a day with them. Go to a college or university with that degree track and talk to the professors and the students. Go to a business in the industry and talk to someone who has been in the field for a long time, talk to them, get perspective. If it doesn't look like there's anyone doing what you want to do, then you can be a pioneer!</p>\r\n",

To read the full interview click <a href='http://womeninplanetaryscience.wordpress.com/2010/09/24/diana-blaney-play-to-your-strengths/' target='_blank'>here</a>. </i></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Where are you from? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I grew up in Ashville, Ohio. I now live in Altadena, Calif.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin clearfix'></div>\n<div class='quote'>\n\"Talking to people, and saying, 'Hey, I'm interested in doing this. What kind of things should I be doing?' is very important.\"\n</div>\n<footer>\n<cite>- Diana Blaney</cite>\n</footer>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin'></div>\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Describe the first time you made a personal connection with outer space. </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I always wanted to be a scientist (although what kind of scientist varied during my childhood). First, I wanted to be a paleontologist and then when I was in sixth grade I read a book about a team of astronauts who explored the solar system and other stars -- the captain was a physicist. So not really knowing what physics was I decided that I would be one and explore the solar system some day.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>How did you end up working in the space program? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I went to college at Ohio State where I majored in engineering physics. While in college, I realized that rather than doing research in physics, I was really more interested in using physics to study how planets work. I earned my Ph.D. at the University of Hawaii, doing ground-based astronomy of Mars. I was able to combine all of the engineering I had learned on the instrumentation side from college with the physics, science and with the creative process -- it was very, very hands-on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My first post-doc opportunity was at the <a href='http://www.jpl.nasa.gov' target='_blank'>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</a> (JPL), because at the time there was a mission called Mars Observer, and it had an instrument that was going to be an imaging spectrometer (from the visible range out to five microns). However, within a month or so after I got to JPL, the instrument was deselected from the mission. I pretty much totally switched fields at that time. I was able to finish my post-doc and I ended up being hired by JPL. There was a lot about JPL (being at the edge of the science and the engineering) that was a really good fit, and I felt I could make a contribution there.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My parents -- I know it sounds clich&eacute;, but I grew up in a small town without a lot of science opportunities in my community. My parents were both teachers and when they saw I was interested in science they took the time to find science oriented things for me to do outside of school -- even if they had to drive hours to get there and then wait all day for the activity to be over. They basically told me that if it was important to me, I could do it.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is a Planetary Scientist? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I study geologic processes on planets. I'm a co-investigator (Co-I) and investigation scientist for ChemCam on the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL). My job on the mission is to worry about how the engineering (stuff being built) and science (what we want to learn about Mars) fit together. Once the instrument I've worked on is at Mars, I get to help take data and then actually analyze the data and figure out what it all means.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have a bunch of different skills that mesh together well for this job. Since I have a degree in engineering, I have the basic knowledge I need to understand how a rover works, and I know how to analyze and interpret the data. My career goal is to someday build my own instrument.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career. </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My favorite moment was the landing of the Mars Exploration Rover Spirit on Mars. It was amazing to be able to see the instruments that you had worked on actually sending back science data from Mars.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The key thing is, early in your career, you need to be useful. You need to be the good team player -- a contributor. Be helpful. This takes really simple things like saying, \"Hey, there's this old data set that would be great in the proposal. I'm going to slog through and get the calibration and make some great figures\" [as an example]. Or talking to people and saying: \"Hey, what can I do?\" So, find something that you can do to contribute, even if it's not really the most \"sexy\" thing out there. Be the team player. If someone asks you to do something -- go out and do it, and look for things to help to make things happen. Hard work is important.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My house is a few miles from the Angeles Crest National Forest, so I see coyotes around pretty regularly (also raccoons, possums and skunks). I try to go hiking in the neighborhood on a regular basis. However, I really like getting to the ocean where I boogie board (I learned in Hawaii). I wear a wet suit though, since the water in California is so cold.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Talk to people, and seek out mentors. Talking to people, and saying, \"Hey, I'm interested in doing this. What kind of things should I be doing?\" is very important.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Figure out what your strengths and weaknesses are, and play to your strengths. For instance, I could never do modeling -- theoretical modeling stuff. I tried a theoretical modeling project and it was a disaster. However, I can figure out what I need to measure and plan observations. So, play to your strengths.</p>\r\n",

It was such an exciting time! My family didn't miss a televised launch -- no matter the hour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Being a collector type, I also started saving clippings of all the newspaper articles I could find about astronauts and space. I thought I could end up with a <i>complete</i> set. When the first large drawer filled up after only a few months, though, I realized that it probably wasn't going to be feasible. Of course, that was an understatement -- there have been thousands and thousands and thousands of articles about spaceflight through all sorts of media since then.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Besides this, my father was an engineer who worked on some of the engines for the X-15 aircraft. He would sometimes bring home eye-popping glossy photographs of the machines and the people involved. I thought they were just too cool -- futuristic airplanes and tough-looking guys in flight suits. I remember doing science projects describing to other fourth graders how fast the X-15 could fly. As if I truly understood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><blockquote>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin clearfix'></div>\n<div class='quote'>\n\"It's mind-boggling that humans can </span><span>create systems that do such amazing </span><span>things over such huge distances.\"\n</div>\n<footer>\n<cite>- Don Boroson</cite>\n</footer>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin'></div>\n</blockquote></span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>How did you end up working in the space program?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>After completing my undergraduate and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering at Princeton University, I came to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's (MIT's) Lincoln Laboratory. At Lincoln Laboratory, I wanted to be able to apply my graduate education (which had been in rather general purpose techniques and analyses concerning signals and the systems that use and process them). Such a background was relevant to a number of areas of interest at Lincoln, and so after interviewing in several of those areas, I pretty much flipped a coin and ended up working in the satellite communications area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It turned out to be a great decision, though. It's always fun knowing that something I worked on is up there 20,000 miles or so. And within the past decade I've worked on NASA projects, which has been fantastic. These can be WAY more than 20,000 miles up there, some as much as ten THOUSAND times -- or more. It's mind-boggling that humans can create systems that do such amazing things over such huge distances.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>That's a tough question. I was influenced by many people while I was growing up -- family, teachers, talented friends, and scientists and other smart and enthusiastic people I saw on television. Inspiration, though, really only came when I grew older and could appreciate at a deeper level why their accomplishments were so amazing.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is a Lasercom System Engineer?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>For the past several decades, I've worked on the technologies for systems that can take a laser beam, impose information onto it (by, say, blinking it on and off) and send it to a far-away receiver through either the vacuum of space or the atmosphere. This is done while trying to have it stay as focused as possible in order to grab a reasonable fraction of the now spread out signal (actually, a very TINY fraction). We then deduce what information has been transmitted through processing that puny amount of received light energy. We call this free-space optical communications, or sometimes laser communications or even just lasercom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each one of those tasks has taken many inventions over the years, and putting them all together into a useful system is a complex exercise. So from my vantage point, a lasercom system engineer decides which particular set of those inventions is best for a particular need, and then makes sure that the selections add up to a working system. For instance, a system that sends lasercom beams from a satellite orbiting Mars down to a terrestrial ground receiver will be very different from a system that sends lasercom beams between two airplanes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, when the opportunity comes to actually build one of these systems and perhaps fly one end (or perhaps both) in space, the task grows to make sure that the real pieces of glass, the real mechanisms, the real lasers, and the real electronics end up producing the results that the invention had promised in the original vision.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career.</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>After working for 15 years in the space-based laser communications area, I was part of a real space lasercom project. I was incredibly excited to be in the operations center when it came time to turn it all on -- after four years of design, development, testing, and finally, the launch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We waited patiently, sending commands and watching the telemetry from the radio control systems, to see if, and when, the lasercom would start to work. All of a sudden, the green light popped on; this meant that the two ends of the system had actually done everything needed to work. The lasercom link was working -- the optically-transmitted data transmitted and received perfectly! People cheered and screamed and jumped up and down and hugged -- unforgettable.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no one right path. You can do well as a specialist or as a generalist, as a work-alone person or as a team manager, as an inventor or as an implementer, as a starter or as a finisher. I would say, make sure you enjoy whatever it is you are doing and then try to do \"that\" well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perhaps even sample various \"flavors\" of the industry -- start some tasks, do what it takes to finish some other tasks, etc. -- in order to become an even better overall contributor. People who rise up have usually gained an appreciation for what it takes to start/finish, invent/implement, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I have played the piano since I was a child and I play whenever I have a free moment. I play all styles of music&mdash;classical, 20th century, ragtime, theater, jazz, rock and roll.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am also a sometime musical-theater music director for local theaters; if my work schedule allows. Being a music director entails teaching and coaching all the singing as well as gathering, rehearsing and then conducting the orchestra during the performances. A great joy has been to watch both my children become experts at the piano and become theater music directors themselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Choose a path that gets you in touch with the best people rather than what seems to be the most interesting technology at the time, at least at the start of your education. Watch how those people work, how they think and how they attack a problem. You can then apply those good habits to whatever technology strikes your fancy later on.</p>\r\n",

I then headed for warmer weather in Southern California.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Describe the first time you made a personal connection with outer space.</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As a kid, my six-inch reflecting telescope was used to marvel at the Moon's craters and Saturn's rings.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>How did you end up working in the space program?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I began working as a contractor for the <a href='http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/home/index.html' target='_blank'>Goddard Space Flight Center</a> (GSFC) fresh out of graduate school (University of Maryland). With my background in solar system dynamics, I joined a Goddard team that was designing missions to comets. Later, in 1976, I joined the <a href='http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/' target='_blank'>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</a> (JPL) in Pasadena, Calif., working in their solar system dynamics group.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the first people to inspire me in science was my undergraduate Middlebury College professor who had a contagious enthusiasm for physics and astronomy. He was tough, and demanded a great deal from his students, but he was so dynamic and interesting that I looked forward to those classes.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is a Planetary Scientist?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Among other activities, planetary scientists work to understand the physical nature, the atmospheric environments and the dynamics of the planets, natural satellites, comets and asteroids. For most of my career, I have been computer modeling the motions of comets and asteroids and making predictions as to where their future motions will take them. Making predictions based upon a model, and verifying those predictions, forms the very core of the modern scientific method.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career.</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I find the many predictions involved with my work to be interesting and rewarding. My predictions were used to discover the return of comet Halley at Palomar Mountain in 1982, and to verify the discovery of the comet Halley observations made way back in 164 B.C. (The 164 B.C observations are recorded on Babylonian clay tablets and are now in the British Museum.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Correctly predicting the positions of comets and asteroids for spacecraft encounters is particularly exhilarating. My initial prediction for a flight project was for the International Comet Explorer (the first comet mission) when it successfully flew through the tail of comet Giacobini-Zinner in September 1985.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our Near Earth Object Program Office at JPL, which includes Alan Chamberlin, Steve Chesley, Paul Chodas, and Jon Giorgini, has provided several predictions for future Earth close approaches (and one impact) by near-Earth comets and asteroids.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I'd advise students to take math and physics courses, but I'd also advise them to be sure to include a healthy dose of liberal arts courses as well (such as English, history and public speaking). One of the goals of a successful scientist is to engage the public in their research work, for it is generally the public's largesse that allows us to work in science. Relating your work to young people is one of the most satisfying jobs for a researcher, but this requires that you clearly express the importance of your research with a few simple statements while using memorable analogies. Making your complex science research \"crystal clear\" for the public is tough -- but very necessary.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I love my job and I can't believe they pay me to have this much fun! I also enjoy tennis and collecting early original works on space travel. My daughter and I also collect and research ancient Roman denarii coins with the portrait likenesses of the early emperors. The lifestyles of these emperors were often tragic and sordid, but oh so interesting.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Find an area of research you love and pursue it with bulldog tenacity. If you do, success will come and you'll never have to \"go to work.\"</p>\r\n",

The amazing combination of engineering, science, exploration and adventure from these images had me hooked from then on!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>How did you end up working in the space program?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><span>I had been producing animations, mosaics and movies of data from spacecraft like the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO), and the Mars Exploration Rovers (MER) Spirit and Opportunity for a few years, and sharing them with people via a forum I founded in 2004 called Unmanned Spaceflight. I was also occasionally volunteering as a guest blogger for The Planetary Society. Through these connections, I met several people from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) who saw what I might be able to bring to their outreach visualization projects. It was hard work to bring everything together to make it happen, but in May 2010 I moved to Pasadena and started working on a visualization project called Eyes on the Solar System. Since then I have also worked on the Destination Mars HoloLens Immersive Reality project, and now work in flight operations on both Opportunity and Curiosity.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><span>My heroes are both inside and outside the field of space exploration. I admire the bravery of explorer Ranulph Fiennes, the persistence of land speed record holder Richard Noble and the tenacity of the Mars Exploration Rover principal investigator Steve Squyres. But if I could pick only one person - Ernest Shackleton - who extols all those virtues and so many besides.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><span>What does your job entail?</span></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><span>As an Engineering Camera Payload Uplink Lead (ECAM PUL), my job is to prepare sequences ( small bundles of spacecraft commands ) that tell a Mars Rover which pictures to take with its Navigation and Hazard Avoidance cameras. I work with the science team and the rover drivers to make sure I'm pointing the cameras the right way. We also have to make sure the commands are not going to hurt the rover, that we will not be taking so much data that we don't receive it on Earth before we start planning the next day. When your commands have to run on a priceless asset 100 million miles from home - you have to double check and triple check they're going to work the right way, do what you need them to do, and not expose the rover to any kind of risk.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><div class='column-width image_module' style=''>\n<figure class='inline_figure'>\n<a class='inline_image_enlarge fancybox' href='/system/internal_resources/details/original/693_Mars_Sol_1611.jpeg'>\n<img alt='Black and white image of Mars' src='/internal_resources/693'>\n<div class='enlarge_icon'></div>\n</a>\n<figcaption>\nDoug's postcard from Mars.

Some of the scientists who work on environmental science (look at the atmosphere, clouds, dust devils and so on) loved the idea and 'donated' some of their time and data to doing it. I prepared a sequence to do it, and finally on Sol 1611 we had the chance to take the images on the rover. They looked beautiful - but there was no shadow! All that work and we didn't get the shadow we wanted. But we learned something - it turns out the atmosphere was very hazy with dust and the sun set behind the dust before is set below the horizon. I managed to take an idea, and turn it into a little postcard from Mars.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><span>What are you looking forward to in your career?</span></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Who knows! That's the exciting part.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Almost every single part of our lives is touched by science, engineering and math. Whatever your interests and passions are, becoming adept in a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, or Math) subject is highly worthwhile. It will allow you to be involved in so many exciting career choices and you will be able to make a positive difference in whatever you choose to pursue. For instance, engineering new medical equipment, calculating new battery technology, designing new efficient cars, building new rockets or programming a spacecraft to land on Mars, STEM subjects are the subjects demanded by the most exciting challenges and adventures facing us today and in the future.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><span>For a kid who grew up in the green rolling hills of rural England, strangely, I adore the Mojave Desert.   I also adore landscape photography and the American South West in general.  I&rsquo;ve gone on many field trips out to interesting places and even helped out with some field work in Death Valley. In August. (Not recommended!). I also love exploring the lava tubes east of Barstow, California and have spent time trying to map them using drones and other imaging techniques. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<div class='column-width image_module' style=''>\n<figure class='inline_figure'>\n<a class='inline_image_enlarge fancybox' href='/system/internal_resources/details/original/696_Lava_Tube.jpeg'>\n<img alt='Lava Tube' src='/internal_resources/696'>\n<div class='enlarge_icon'></div>\n</a>\n<figcaption>\nDoug's photo inside a lava tube.

There, we would go out at night and view the stars. I remember being fascinated by everything I was learning and seeing.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin clearfix'></div>\n<div class='quote'>\n<span>In addition to teaching my students the value of good research, I try to help them hone their writing and speaking skills.

All of the exciting new data about water on Mars piqued my interest in water-rock interactions on Mars, as well as on the Earth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While a postdoc at NASA&rsquo;s Johnson Space Center, I worked on phosphate mobility on Mars. I am lucky enough to still be working on phosphate on Mars with my own graduate students as a professor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. I think one of the most helpful things about my postdoc was writing a proposal for the work I was going to do, and then working to execute it &ndash; good practice for being a faculty member!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is an Associate Professor of Geoscience?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I am lucky to have a great job. I get to do a combination of research, teaching, and working with students in many different capacities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I teach a variety of classes, including general education classes such as &ldquo;Physical Geography&rdquo; and &ldquo;Global Warming,&rdquo; and upper level classes such as &ldquo;Principles of Geochemistry.&rdquo; I have several excellent graduate students, as well as undergraduate students, who work in my lab. (I am always looking for good students to work with -- see link below.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I also participate in running the department, including, right now, a stint as Graduate Admissions Coordinator.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career.</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I am lucky enough to have lots of happy moments in my career. Probably my most rewarding moments are the successes of my students -- I am so proud of them when they get papers accepted for publication, receive funding and fellowships for their work, awards for their research, and after they graduate go on to enjoy professional success in their chosen field. I am also very excited to be working on the Returned Sample Science Board which is helping provide scientific guidance on aspects of Mars sample return for the Mars2020 mission.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My Ph.D. advisor, Sue Brantley, and postdoc advisor, Doug Ming, are shining examples of scientists and advisors -- I am very lucky to have worked with them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am also grateful to lots of other people who have helped me along the way, and to the great scientists of history who are each very inspiring.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to teaching my students the value of good research, I try to help them hone their writing and speaking skills. Writing and speaking well will aid you in any career you pursue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I also encourage my students to apply for external funding. This is good practice for writing proposals, and is prestigious if you do receive it. I would specifically recommend applying for NASA graduate and postdoc fellowships. The <a href='http://nasa.orau.org/postdoc/' target='_blank'>NASA Postdoc Program</a> provides support for postdoctoral research for up to three years at a NASA center. Here&rsquo;s how it works: You write a proposal to work with a particular mentor at a specific NASA center. If selected, you will be able to do your research there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to practice in writing proposals, I think another valuable experience in graduate school -- or as a postdoc -- is to mentor undergraduate students. Making the transition from being a graduate student to a professor who mentors graduate students is not easy, but one of the things that made it easier for me was having mentored undergraduate students while I was still a graduate student.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I also advise taking part in the &ldquo;<a href='http://serc.carleton.edu/NAGTWorkshops/careerdev/index.html' target='_blank'>On the Cutting Edge</a>&rdquo; workshops available for graduate students and faculty members though the National Association of Geoscience Teachers. I have attended both the graduate student and early career faculty workshops. I strongly encourage everyone to apply &ndash; attending these workshops has been among the most useful few days I have spent in my entire professional life. (Parts of the workshops were based on the work of Robert Boice, which is also a good resource). </p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I love to be outside, hiking and camping in the many great locations near Las Vegas with my family. I also love to read.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I would give them advice about practicing the necessary skills that I mentioned above, but I would also encourage them to be resilient and persistent. In addition to all the wonderful moments that make this such a great career, there are also discouraging moments that everyone experiences &ndash; papers get rejected, proposals get rejected, job applications get rejected &hellip; This happens, to everyone, and so I would encourage students to learn from their experiences, and persevere.</p>\r\n",

Read on to learn more about her journey, including her early days as a CNN writer/producer, breaking NASA's TRAPPIST-1 news to the world, and how improv helped her overcome her decades-long struggle with shyness.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What first sparked your interest in space and science?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My parents say that when I was about 2 or 3 years old, I loved watching the original \"Cosmos\" series hosted by Carl Sagan. It must have really made an impression! I also loved going to the Franklin Institute Science Museum in Philadelphia, which had a giant model of a human heart that kids could climb through, and lots of other fun exhibits. Really, anything to do with science was interesting to me, even in childhood.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>How did you end up working in the space program?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Even though I loved physics and math in high school, I majored in anthropology, with certificates in creative writing and Spanish, in college. During my junior year, I was the editor-in-chief of <i>Innovation</i>, the Princeton University student science magazine, but had no notion of actually working in the space program at that point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I worked as a writer/producer at CNN Digital, I often wrote about the exciting developments at NASA, such as Voyager 1 entering interstellar space and the Curiosity rover landing on Mars. But I never thought about working at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory until I happened to see a job posting for the media office. </p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about your job. What do you do as a Senior Storyteller?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I direct content packages for various NASA websites on everything from exoplanets to solar system topics. I run brainstorming meetings, attend conferences and look for the best ways to communicate the great work NASA does to the public.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=''>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin clearfix'></div>\n<div class='quote'>\n\"I&rsquo;ve always been very determined to have a career that I believed in, that would allow me to learn something new every day.

For several months prior to the TRAPPIST-1 announcement, I coordinated the many ways that various teams across NASA were going to communicate the results. I wanted to make sure that all of the text stories, videos and artwork were showing a consistent vision of the TRAPPIST-1 system, and that everyone involved had a clear understanding of what we do and do not know about these wondrous planets. It was really amazing for me to be involved in early conversations with the scientists about how these planets might look, just based on data plots.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='column-width image_module' style=''>\n<figure class='inline_figure'>\n<img alt='Liz Landau' src='/internal_resources/683'>\n</figure>\n</div>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>On her love of creative writing, dealing with rejection, and working on a novel:</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I really liked writing short fiction when I was in high school. I founded and edited a literary magazine in high school called &ldquo;Beyond&rdquo; (fiction and poetry) and I wrote short fiction for that. In college, I wanted to do Princeton's creative writing certificate program, which is known for world-famous writers. Each of the courses required an application, and I was actually rejected several times. But in the fall of my junior year, I saw that David Ebershoff, whose book \"Pasadena\" (about the city in the 1800s) I had read, was teaching a course. I showed up to his first class and talked my way into staying on. David taught me a lot about developing distinct voices for characters and finding inspiration for stories. Because I pushed back against the initial rejection and developed stories I was proud of in that class, I was formally admitted to the thesis-writing program. My senior year, I got to fulfill my dream of studying with Joyce Carol Oates, who was my thesis advisor. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>At that time, for my senior thesis, I wrote a novella based on my experience in Spain and my anthropology research about Spanish-Jewish history. Since then, I&rsquo;ve tried to work on a new novel that sort of touches on that one. It&rsquo;s my big personal project to finish and publish it one day.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>On forging her own path to pursue a writing career:</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My parents had great careers in other fields, but no one in my family is a professional writer. When I started going in that direction, my family members saw that choice as unconventional, and thought I would come around to the idea of law school (my dad is a lawyer). But I remember having lengthy conversations with friends of mine in college, the kind of conversations people go to college for&mdash;<i>How can we build lives for ourselves that we find meaningful, beyond merely earning money? </i>We wanted to have careers we were passionate about and genuinely interested in, as opposed to a means to an end. I&rsquo;ve always been very determined to have a career that I believed in, that would allow me to learn something new every day. I want to be constantly learning and I feel really lucky to always been able to have jobs like that. Every day I am exposed to something new&mdash;people, ideas, or ways of doing things. </p>\r\n\r\n<h3>On growing up shy:</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Throughout my life, I&rsquo;ve gone from being an extremely shy introvert to more of an outgoing extrovert. It&rsquo;s been a gradual uphill climb. I used to be super shy. When I was really young, I felt like I didn't know how to talk to other kids. I was amazed by how people fluidly spoke to each other without thinking too hard about it, without appearing to have any kind of embarrassment or reservation about what they were saying. I've definitely developed confidence over time&mdash;now I can very quickly and comfortably switch from talking about something like physics to personal matters, and be totally open to listening to others as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What changed for you?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>When I was about 27 and living in Atlanta, Georgia (during my time at CNN), I took classes in improvisational comedy at Relapse Theater. Improv helps you be in the moment with someone you&rsquo;re talking to. One of the ground rules of improv is that no choice that you make on stage is \"wrong.\" Whatever you say or do is inherently the \"right\" thing, because everyone else in the scene has to go along with it. I felt that this was super liberating and helped me better confront a whole spectrum of real-world interactions. </p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>On her favorite space image:</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<div class='column-width image_module' style=''>\n<figure class='inline_figure'>\n<img alt='Ceres' src='/internal_resources/684'>\n</figure>\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Since Dawn was the first mission I worked on in JPL's media office, I feel I should mention one of the spectacular views of Ceres that Dawn has delivered. In February 2015, before entering orbit at Ceres, Dawn captured this image (above) of Ceres that showed what appeared to be two bright \"lights\" in the center of a crater. We know now, having seen the crater up close, that there are a multitude of bright spots in that crater, and that they are made of salt, which reflects light rather than producing it. This was an image that really got me excited about working on the mission and sharing the amazing feats of Dawn. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is the biggest challenge in your job?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the biggest challenges in science communication is characterizing uncertainty. The longer I spend at JPL, the better I understand that while our spacecraft show us wondrous things, no one study or set of data will have all the answers we want. Scientists use that data to formulate theories about the planets and the broader universe that are plausible, but not 100 percent proven. They are the best theories we have, but they are still theories. There is a very delicate balance here, because I want to share the excitement of exploration, but I also don't want to overstate the conclusions that one can draw from the results. This is something I have thought about a lot in I working on news announcements. </p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What&rsquo;s one piece of advice you would give to others interested in a similar career?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>When I was in school, social media did not exist. Podcasts did not exist. Many of the other multimedia platforms commonly used to tell stories today did not exist. I didn't learn about any of these things in journalism graduate school, but I had to quickly adapt in professional settings to the changing landscape. So I would say that you should follow your passions and dreams, but also be open to learning new technologies and ways of thinking, as they may help you advance your goals.</p>\r\n",

      "body": "<h3><b>Where are you from?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I grew up in Wellesley, Mass. and went to college in Cambridge, Mass. I attended graduate school in Tucson, Ariz., and I stayed on as a postdoc and then in a research faculty position. So I lived in Arizona for several years before moving to Columbia, Md, where I currently live.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin clearfix'></div>\n<div class='quote'>\n\"Being a planetary scientist and working with spacecraft missions is one of the coolest jobs on the planet (which is not to say that I wouldn't have loved to have qualified for a job that would take me off this planet!), but it's not always easy, and just because it isn't always easy doesn't mean you can't do it and do it well.\"\n</div>\n<footer>\n<cite>- Zibi Turtle</cite>\n</footer>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin'></div>\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Describe the first time you made a personal connection with outer space.</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks to my dad and my grandmother, my sister and I spent a lot of time looking up at the sky when we were growing up. My grandmother knew all of the constellations and the mythology associated with them and was wonderful at telling the stories. My dad would let us stay up late, or wake us up in the middle of the night, to see meteor showers (which I remember thinking were pretty scary at the time), lunar eclipses, aurorae, and comets. Sometimes he'd get out the telescope he built, and we'd just explore the sky. We would also make pinholes in cardboard to follow partial solar eclipses.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>How did you end up working in the space program?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Our favorite board game growing up was called \"Space Hop.\" In this game you were given a mission assignment with the characteristics of your destination, but not the name. In order to win the game, you needed to discover which solar system object you were to go to from the clues given in your assignment. Eventually we not only knew the answers, but we also knew which ones had become outdated as exploration of the solar system progressed -- growing up in the 1970s there were the Pioneers, Vikings, and Voyagers to follow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We watched \"Nova\" and, of course, \"Cosmos,\" avidly. And then there was the Space Shuttle, which was incredibly inspirational to me. So, it's hardly a surprise that I ended up in planetary science.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I started college at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) I was pretty sure I wanted to study space science. I decided to major in physics since it was broader in scope, and started with elective courses in astrophysics (which was completely fascinating) astronomical observing, and a particularly fun seminar in celestial navigation. However, it was the courses in planetary science that really grabbed me -- the idea of being able to go to planets and moons and actually explore them (if not in person) with robotic missions, was (and is) incredibly exciting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I went to the University of Arizona's Lunar and Planetary Laboratory (LPL) for my graduate studies in planetary science and remained there as a postdoc. While a postdoc, I had the opportunity to be a principal investigator (PI) on my own grant proposals, which was a valuable opportunity (and which isn't always available to postdocs -- it depends on the institution). I was also awarded a research grant through the Planetary Science Institute (also in Tucson), and so I worked there as a research scientist part of the time. Working at two different institutions was a great experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During my postdoc, I started to apply for other positions including a research faculty position at the University of Arizona, which I was offered and took. After a few years there, my husband I decided to look into what other options were available to us and were fortunate enough to both get job offers at a few different places. Of those, the Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) was the best fit. In particular because we both enjoy a combination of research and working on missions.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is a Planetary Scientist?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Planetary science covers a very broad range of science topics and research techniques. Planetary scientists study everything about planets, including the Earth, as well as other objects in the solar system like moons, dwarf planets, Pluto, and other Kuiper Belt objects, asteroids, and comets etc.). They also study planets being discovered around other stars. Areas of research include planetary surfaces, atmospheres, magnetic fields, deep interiors, rings, dynamics (the interactions between the Sun, planets, moons, rings, etc.), and how the different objects formed and have changed through their history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Planetary scientists use a very wide variety of tools, including: observations made from telescopes on Earth or in Earth orbit (e.g., the Hubble Space Telescope; observations made remotely or in situ by spacecraft (e.g., Cassini in orbit around Saturn and the Huygens probe that made measurements as it descended through Titan's atmosphere, the orbiters and rovers exploring Mars, MESSENGER in orbit around Mercury, the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter at Earth's Moon, etc.); theoretical work; computer simulations; and laboratory studies. An example is reproducing chemical reactions (and potentially biological activity) that could occur in planetary atmospheres, seas and interiors, and recreating geological processes like impact cratering experiments at a small scale. So planetary scientists have a very diverse set of job descriptions.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career.</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The excitement of seeing new territory or seeing previously explored terrain in a different way (new wavelength, higher resolution, topography, etc.) and making new discoveries really can't be beat -- one of my favorite memories is going into the office late one evening to see brand new images of Io that had just been played back from Galileo. Io's a particularly exciting planetary target, because it's the most volcanically active object in our solar system. As a result, every time you look at it something has changed, often many things. Being one of the first people to get to see the effects of new eruptions on Io was an amazing feeling. On one flyby, Galileo actually caught an active fire-fountain eruption in its early stages, which was quite a surprise! We had a great group studying Galileo's observations of Io, and often we'd look through the images together and toss around new ideas to explain what the images were showing us, which was a lot of fun.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCassini and Huygens' exploration of Titan has been similarly exciting. Because of Titan's thick, hazy atmosphere, its surface had barely been seen before Cassini and Huygens arrived. The first infrared and radar images revealed the surface, but in many cases the features were still quite hard to interpret because Titan's so different from other places we've explored (see these two images: <a href='http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA06141' target='_blank'>\"Hovering Over Titan\"</a> and <a href='http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA06988' target='_blank'>\"Diversity on Titan\"</a>). So Titan was still a very unfamiliar place when the Huygens probe descended through the atmosphere making measurements of the atmosphere and taking images of the surface. When we saw those images for the first time, it was amazing to see instantly recognizable features like river channels (<a href='http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA07236' target='_blank'>\"Mosaic of River Channel and Ridge Area on Titan\"</a>) and familiar Earth-like landscapes (<a href='http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA06440' target='_blank'>\"View from Titan's Surface\"</a>) on such an alien world!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to strong role models in my family, I had many great teachers in school, college and grad school, who encouraged and inspired me to pursue my interests. I've been lucky to have many excellent mentors, especially undergraduate and graduate advisors and my postdoctoral advisor. Another major source of inspiration for me, particularly in grad school and beyond, has been my peers -- fellow students, postdocs, etc. -- who have followed their own paths, despite challenges and obstacles.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Being a planetary scientist and working with spacecraft missions is one of the coolest jobs on the planet (which is not to say that I wouldn't have loved to have qualified for a job that would take me off this planet!), but it's not always easy, and just because it isn't always easy doesn't mean you can't do it and do it well.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are certainly people to whom scientific research (and the entire scientific process, including getting proposals funded, writing papers, public speaking, etc.) comes naturally and even easily (or, perhaps more to the point, seems to), but it's OK if it doesn't. Hard work and perseverance (or sometimes just plain stubbornness) are effective too. It also seems to me that there's a huge element of luck and just being in the right place at the right time, so patience is essential.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finding good people to work with can make a big difference (and by \"good\" I don't mean only in terms of being a good scientist, but also in terms of having similar philosophies to yours and who are supportive and encourage you to develop and follow your own ideas). I've been lucky to work with some really excellent scientists and mentors; some of the best mentors I had in graduate school were other graduate students.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I also think that taking advantage of opportunities for a variety of experiences in graduate school (and as a post-doc) is very important too. Of course there's a risk of getting spread too thin, so it can be a tricky balance (one which I wish I knew better how to achieve!).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I'd encourage them to follow their interests both within and outside of school, and not to be shy about seeking out answers to questions from teachers and others in the community, for example at science museums, nearby colleges and universities, or even remotely through websites, blogs, email, etc. -- most scientists really enjoy talking about their research! Also, keep persevering even when things get difficult or you question yourself. Hard work and dedication make a huge difference.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I row competitively with the Baltimore Rowing Club and I weight train, which takes up much of the rest of my time. When I lived in Tucson, Ariz., I was fortunate enough to get to play Taiko (Japanese drumming) with the drumming ensemble Odaiko Sonora. My preference for team-oriented extracurricular activities may also explain why I enjoy working in teams on missions, research projects, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My favorite activity is hanging out with my family (lots of nieces, nephews, cousins, etc.) and I try to visit them as often as possible. I also like to ski, read, travel, cook, and a bunch of other things I rarely have time for -- I'm not terribly good at achieving a work-life balance, but I have found that having connections and commitments outside of work makes a big and very positive difference. For me, it's especially helpful to regain an external perspective or even an escape when I've been beating my head against the wall on one project or another for too long.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>This profile has been adapted in part from an original interview conducted by Kelsi Singer for Susan Niebur's \"Women in Planetary Science\" website.

What fascinated me was not only the vast expanse and dangers of space, but that teams of engineers rallied together to solve what seemed to be insurmountable problems. I remember watching them succeed and knowing that this was the kind of career I would like to pursue &ndash; one where I would be able to use creativity, knowledge, and teamwork to advance space exploration. As a systems engineer today, solving seemingly unsolvable problems are part of my daily life and something that I get a lot of pleasure doing!</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='column-width image_module' style=''>\n<figure class='inline_figure'>\n<img alt='MarCO Lab' src='/internal_resources/667'>\n<figcaption>\nFarah and a colleague in the cleanroom with Mars Cube Sat One.\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>How did you end up working in the space program? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I studied Aerospace Engineering at the University of Cambridge and got the amazing opportunity to participate in the NASA Academy, which is one of the many internships NASA offers, at Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) after I finished my Master&rsquo;s degree. Through the Academy, I was introduced to the many NASA centers and activities NASA partakes in, which is when I discovered my bug for robotic planetary exploration. That led me to doing a PhD in Systems Engineering at MIT, during which I continued to intern at NASA, this time at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). I fell in love with the place, and couldn&rsquo;t wait to go to work every day and work with some of the most visionary people I&rsquo;ve ever met. From landing SUV-sized rovers on Mars to navigating spacecraft around other planets, there&rsquo;s nothing that can stop them. When I was offered a position to join them full-time, I didn&rsquo;t hesitate one second to say yes!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><blockquote>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin clearfix'></div>\n<div class='quote'>\n\"I grew up in a small town where working at NASA was unheard of.

They were both born in Madagascar, which they left during civil unrest to immigrate to Canada, and were the first generation in their families to attend college. Growing up, they always encouraged me to pursue my dreams. They led by example and showed me that I could achieve whatever I put my mind to. My parents also sacrificed a great deal to make sure that I could get a good education and that I pushed myself to the best of my abilities. Their influence is still very apparent in me today: as an engineer, like my father, one of my passions is to give back to the community through education and public outreach, having developed a passion for teaching from my mother.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><div class='column-width image_module' style=''>\n<figure class='inline_figure'>\n<img alt='Farah' src='/internal_resources/668'>\n</figure>\n</div></span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What does your job entail? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><span>As a systems engineer, I describe myself as a \"jack-of-all-trades.\" When working on mission proposals and early mission concepts, my role is to help design the initial spacecraft by helping the different subsystem experts (e.g.: thermal, telecommunications, power) collaborate while keeping within the launch vehicle and spacecraft capability. One of the proposals I&rsquo;ve most enjoyed working on is a solar mission to Saturn which aims at looking for life at Saturn&rsquo;s Moon Enceladus. At Saturn, large solar arrays only provide enough power to light up the equivalent of 3 lightbulbs &ndash; you can imagine that designing a spacecraft that does complex experiments with such little power is not an easy feat!</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>More recently, I have been working as a Payload Systems Engineer on the InSight Mars lander. InSight is launching an ultra-sensitive seismometer and a self-hammering heat probe to the surface of Mars in order to study its interior and understand how it was formed. As a Payload Systems Engineer, my role has involved ensuring that the appropriate systems tests are performed and analyzing the resulting data in order to verify that InSight will be able to achieve its science objectives once it lands on the surface of Mars. The lander was built at Lockheed Martin and the instruments are international contributions, so I&rsquo;ve had the chance to work with a range of different institutions. From 2014-2016, I was also the Systems Engineer on the MarCO CubeSats, a companion mission to InSight; I have quite a long history with the mission as a whole and cannot wait for it to reveal the mysteries of Mars!</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><div class='center image_module' style=''>\n<figure class='inline_figure'>\n<img alt='FILE:SpaceShuttleSimulator.jpg' src='/images/content/SpaceShuttleSimulator.jpg'>\n<figcaption>\nFarah in the Space Shuttle simulator.\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What are you looking forward to in your career? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Having only recently joined JPL, there is still so much for me to learn and I am very much looking forward to keep learning as part of my career. More broadly though, NASA is a pioneer in space exploration and pushes humanity&rsquo;s understanding of our universe every day. I am excited for all the discoveries that will be made during my time here. From understanding the origins of our universe to finding life on other planetary bodies, many of these key questions may be answered in my lifetime!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give someone who wants to take the same career path as you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether you want a career in aerospace or any other field, my one piece of advice is to not scare away from your dreams and not give up. I grew up in a small town where working at NASA was unheard of. I worked hard, persevered, and eventually made it to where I am despite many obstacles along the way. Through that process, never forget to enjoy what you are doing. It is my passion for space exploration that has helped me keep motivated and that brings me happiness every day that I come to work.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Like many engineers, I love being outdoors and go hiking and camping fairly regularly. I also enjoy weight lifting and biking. Having grown up in Canada, I am an avid skier and a huge fan of ice hockey. I am a Big Sister as part of the Big Brother/Big Sister (BBBSLA) program, and I also regularly participate in a variety of outreach activities, including giving talks, mentoring students, and teaching at space camp.</p>\r\n",

In 1981, at a <i>Magnetospheres of the Outer Planets</i> meeting, my thesis work was being shown by several speakers and during a break, a female senior scientist asked me what I planned to do next. I replied that I was thinking of going back to England. She went back to the meeting and at the next break a British scientist she was sitting next to offered me a job. After a year finishing up work at MIT (and a trip to climb mountains in Peru) I started a post-doc at Imperial College (IC) in London. I spent five years at IC -- getting a fellowship to support later years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Due to decreased academic research funding and little planetary research in the U.K. it became clear to me that I wanted to return to the U.S. I also realized I felt more comfortable in the American academic system. Soon after this, I got an email from my Voyager colleagues in Boulder saying that the University of Colorado (CU) was looking for faculty in the physical sciences. As a climber and a skier, I realized that Boulder was clearly the place I wanted to live. I was given tenure four years later and have been on the faculty at CU for 21 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Carl Sagan. My older brother was studying at Cambridge University and he invited me to a talk that was being given by Sagan. At this talk, Sagan spoke about the Mariner 9 exploration of Mars, and he showed us images (fuzzy compared with those taken recently). What impressed me was the way he addressed the questioning from the (rather stuffy) Cambridge academics with honest discussion of the science and intellectual challenges.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is a Professor of Astrophysical and Planetary Sciences and Co-Investigator for the New Horizons Mission? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I am a professor of astrophysical and planetary sciences at the University of Colorado, Boulder. My favorite classes to teach are the smaller classes for majors in planetary science where students keep asking great questions and we discuss the latest data coming in from a planetary mission.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am also a co-investigator on the New Horizons mission. I really enjoy my involvement in space missions -- it is the best part of my job -- Voyager, Galileo, Deep Space 1, New Horizons, and Juno. Usually, I am on the science team as a plasma scientist. I study the magnetic fields of planets, the ionized gases trapped in those magnetic fields and the interactions of plasma with the atmospheres of moons, comets, etc. You can study such phenomena by either using instruments on spacecraft that fly through the plasma or via their emissions at different wavelengths -- ideally, using both techniques together.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career. </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The rewards are, without question, seeing the new data coming in. During the 1979 Voyager 1 flyby of Jupiter, I remember seeing the data coming out of a printer which showed the measurements of ionized sulfur and oxygen from the recently discovered volcanoes on Io.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The challenges of mission work are the effort and time it takes to get there -- advocating the mission, proposing, designing, building, launching, getting out to the planet and then, finally, waiting for the data to come back. For Jupiter missions, the process takes about 10-15 years. We started working on a mission to Pluto in 1989 -- 26 years before New Horizons is due to fly past Pluto.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It's a great job! And there are all sorts of jobs&mdash;mission design, mission operations, data analysis, modeling. You need to think about what you like doing most. Is it digging through the data to find the nugget you know is there? Is it developing a model and seeing the science evolving in progressively complex plots? Is it discussing with a team how to implement a set of measurements? Yes, grades are important. Yes, publications are important. But also, contrary to common misconception, getting along with people is also important&mdash;perhaps as important as solving big equations.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I am a rock climber and I enjoy skiing. </p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Talk with a range of people about what it takes to succeed in different types of jobs. Also, learn the basic tools (math, writing, programming, presenting&mdash;and arguing!)&mdash;you can apply them to multiple situations.</p>\r\n",

I was not destined to go to university; nobody in my family had yet graduated from high school. However, access to higher education in my country came along right in time for me. I came to the United States to do a postdoc at Washington University in St. Louis and remained there for 35 years. When I retired, I returned to my native Belgium and I am currently living in Brussels surrounded by my many friends.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Describe the first time you made a personal connection with outer space.</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There was no space science when I was growing up! However, I was good in math and science and I read a lot, and not just about science. When I first heard about meteorites (mid-way through graduate school, in a talk by Brian Mason who was then the meteorite curator at the Smithsonian), I was fascinated by the fact that they could give us information about the early solar system from well over four billion years ago.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>How did you end up working in the space program?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>While at the University of Brussels I became particularly interested in radioactivity. During my last year I took a course in radioactive methods applied to the geological sciences. While taking this class, I was offered a job by the teacher, Edgard Picciotto. Picciotto had wintered over in Antarctica during the International Geophysical Year (IGY: 1957-8) and was pioneering the use of isotopic methods in Antarctic ice. After a while, I asked to be considered as a Ph.D. candidate. (I was frustrated by my supervisor who did not do much and would take the results of my work to the boss as her own). Picciotto took me on as a Ph.D. candidate and from then on everything was wonderful -- I had entered a new life that held the joy of discovery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While a Ph.D. candidate, I developed the Pb210 dating method and studied fission products in polar snows. This was at a time when no women went to Antarctica. Needless to say, I had no idea that someday I would finally get the opportunity to go there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The transition to space science (actually the study of meteorites) came about due to the Ph.D. requirements in Brussels: I had to come up with an idea for another Ph.D. thesis. It was at this time that I had noticed that estimates of the flux of interplanetary dust on Earth varied over nine orders of magnitude. I suggested that the flux could be better estimated using Mn53 (which is induced in space by cosmic rays on interplanetary dust) in Antarctic ice. This led me to read most of what was known about meteorites in the early 1960s. From then on, the study of extraterrestrial matter became a passion for me.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is a Professor Emerita?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I am retired now and hold the position of professor emerita. Apart from the thrill of research, when I was active in the field I most enjoyed training and interacting with an exciting group of gifted graduate students whose postgraduate accomplishments are still a constant source of pleasure.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment in your career.</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I had met Bob Walker at a conference on meteorites and he offered me a postdoctoral position in his laboratory. The first \"big\" event was certainly the arrival and study of the Apollo 11 lunar samples. Our group was one of only 150 worldwide selected to analyze them. We studied the cosmic rays and the radiation history of the lunar samples using mainly nuclear particle tracks, which were revealed by techniques invented by Walker. We worked non-stop (every day and every evening, except for Saturday mornings which were reserved for grocery shopping and apartment cleaning) until the first Lunar Science Conference in early January 1970 in Houston, Texas where we arrived with our science paper after having worked \"incommunicado\" for four months. It was intense, but great fun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then there was the search for meteorites in Antarctica. It was the accomplishment of an old dream -- one which I thought would never be realized as I had changed fields. However, in the mid-1970s it became obvious that Antarctica could become a great source for meteorites. Thanks to Bill Cassidy, who led the Antarctic Search for Meteorites (ANSMET) for so many years, I participated in two meteorite search expeditions. I truly loved these experiences. After the first trip, Bob Walker (whom I had married in the meantime) claimed that there was only one crazy person in the family, but he nevertheless joined me for the second experience, this time in the gorgeous Beardmore area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And then there is the infinity of \"smaller\" moments: finding the answer to a longstanding question in the middle of the night ... working with graduate students, seeing them develop and watching their postgraduate accomplishments.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Edgard Picciotto. He was the person who really made a scientist out of me. He was a wonderful mentor and from him I learned to look at all aspects of a problem with a critical mind, which was definitely not a part of the curriculum in European universities at the time. I learned to be rigorous, to take all data into account whether they favored one's prejudices or not and first and foremost I learned to write. Picciotto dissected my Ph.D. thesis for both content and style and I never forgot this lesson (which I then subsequently used with all my graduate students).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Attend conferences. I took my graduate students to conferences as soon as financially possible, even in their first year when they had no results to present. I remember going to my first conference (only after completing my Ph.D.) I came back feeling so excited: a Nobel Prize winner asked the first question after my presentation. I also made contacts that proved useful later on, and received two postdoc offers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Presenting a paper at a conference is also an opportunity for students to pause and reconsider where their project is heading, and hone their skills to write an abstract and verbally present the essentials in a logical and convincing way.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I love to travel, I swim every day, I have always enjoyed reading, music&mdash;and now I have time for my friends.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>For all: Go for what you really want to do (and have fun along the way). Learn to write well -- it is indispensable. Be visible: Attend and contribute to scientific meetings and make contacts. I really enjoyed collaborating with others and these collaborations were mainly established at scientific meetings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For graduate students: Carefully choose your mentor -- you will have to work with him/her for a few years. Looking back, I see that a lot of \"luck\" (for lack of a better word) and chance encounters aided my career. And, finally, do not be afraid to take some risks ... sometimes.<br />\r\n </p>\r\n",

My second effort focused on an inspection system technology for the space station batteries. I also worked on the development of an ultrasonic transducer that would survive the temperature extremes of space -- namely, -350 degrees Fahrenheit (-212.2 degrees Celsius) to +350 degrees Fahrenheit (+176.6 degrees Celsius).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>How did you end up working in the space program? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I work for the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI), which has worked with NASA for many years on developing various types of technologies. SwRI has an outstanding international reputation for Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE) technology development. For example, the space shuttle is a very complex structure that has a large variety of components that must be nondestructively evaluated before flight. These components include bonding of heat tiles, ensuring the structural integrity of the leading edge, auxiliary power turbines, foam insulation, internal composite structures and many others. My work at SwRI has been to take these components and apply ultrasonic, eddy current, ultraviolet, infrared and many other energy fields that can be used to interact with the component in such a way that information can be obtained about the quality of the component.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The person who inspired me most was my college physics professor, Dr. Virgil Bottom. He was a retired physicist who did much of the initial work in using piezoelectric materials for oscillators. Dr. Bottom had a tremendous love for physics and had a way of taking <i>book physics</i> and making it into something very tangible. He insisted that his students read theory and then go to the lab to practice understanding the potential lab issues associated with the assumptions made in the theory and measurement accuracies.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is a Director of the Department of Sensor Systems and Nondestructive Evaluation Technology? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As the Director of the Sensor Systems and NDE Technology Department, I direct physicists, technicians and engineers (mechanical, electrical and computer) to develop technologies, systems and procedures for nondestructively evaluating components to ensure their safe operation. In addition, my job is to ultimately transfer this technology to the client.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career. </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Being selected by the Research Committee of the American Society of Nondestructive Testing (ASNT) for Sustained Excellence in Research was definitely a favorite moment so far in my career.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I would advise young engineers to approach a new problem by thinking through an experiment before doing it, in order to be prepared to handle things that don't work out as expected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Secondly, I advise that science and engineering should be accomplished without bias. I have seen so many engineers attack a problem believing that it cannot be done. To me this is a bias that will cause the project to fail. On the other hand, it is important to not be overly optimistic. When a few tests indicate that the project will fail, stop. Don't be so positively biased, that you don't know when to stop.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Study hard, always ask <i>why</i>, and when you don't understand something or can't understand something, don't stop studying -- keep working on it. Someday when you have grown in your technical knowledge, you <i>will</i> be able to understand it. And if you do this, you may have many <i>Eureka</i> moments, and your career will be very rewarding.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I love to play music in a band.

My father was an aeronautical engineer at the Rand Corp. in Santa Monica, Calif. My mother worked as a secretary.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Describe the first time you made a personal connection with outer space. </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I vaguely remember my father taking me outside to watch one of the first satellites pass overhead. It was probably Echo, but I think I was far too young to figure out what he was pointing at.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin clearfix'></div>\n<div class='quote'>\n\"I guess I got hooked on space through science fiction...I took away a vision of the future where technology made life simpler and happier rather than just busier and more complicated.\"\n</div>\n<footer>\n<cite>- Gordon Johnston</cite>\n</footer>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin'></div>\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>I guess I got hooked on space through science fiction. One early book that made an impression on me was \"The Forgotten Door\" by Alexander Key. The main character comes from a time or place far more advanced than Earth in the present day. From the book I took away a vision of the future where technology made life simpler and happier rather than just busier and more complicated. At one point I read the whole science fiction section at my local library, reading my way across every shelf.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Several books by Arthur C. Clarke made an impression on me, including \"The Deep Range\" and \"The City and the Stars.\" What I liked about \"The Deep Range\" is that it was about using the skills we learn in space to explore our oceans and feed the planet.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>How did you end up working in the space program? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It was a lucky break. I was working on my master's degree in mathematics, and I wanted to do space-related work. (I had applied to NASA's <a href='http://www.jpl.nasa.gov' target='_blank'>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</a> (JPL) in Pasadena, but had yet to hear from them.) One day while looking through the Los Angeles Times I came across a want ad for mathematicians, which turned out to be for a contractor job at JPL working on the Viking 1 mission to Mars. I applied, interviewed and got the job. JPL liked my work, and when the Galileo mission to Jupiter got its new start a year later, JPL hired me as a permanent employee working half time on Viking and half time on Galileo.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I would have to say first my father and second, the writings of Arthur C. Clarke.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My father was a competent engineer; he knew how to make things work. My father was also an airplane enthusiast. His hobby was to build accurate scale replicas of World War I aircraft. These replicas had gas engines and flew, controlled by \"U-control\" wires. I grew up helping him build, fly and repair these models.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most Americans believe in the future, that the world we leave our children can be better than the world today; that it is our duty to work to make this true. Arthur C. Clarke wrote \"The Deep Range\" in 1957 when the world's population was approaching 3 billion. In this book he speculated that as the world's population grew to 6 billion, we would have to expand and farm the algae fields of our oceans in much the same way we have expanded and farm the grasslands on our continents. Today the world's population is over seven billion, and the UN medium projection is that we will peak at over 9 billion people later in this century. It is too late, and there are too many of us to go \"back to nature,\" at least for the foreseeable future. But what we can do is use technology, including space technology, wisely and sustainably to gain the knowledge and capabilities to give all of us on Earth the opportunity to live rich and fulfilling lives.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is a Program Executive? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I am currently a program executive in the Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C. NASA currently runs its robotic space missions by having a team of three people at the Headquarters level who monitor the development and implementation of each mission. The program executive (PE for short) follows the engineering aspects of the mission; the program scientist (PS) makes sure the mission will achieve its science goals, while the resource analyst (RA) looks after the money and congressional reporting requirements.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career. </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I have the most fun when I am learning new things or working with a team of dedicated people to understand a challenging problem or to assess widely varying technical options. I enjoy it when we turn a problem around, look at it in a new way and come up with approaches to solutions that were not obvious before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Often in my line of work it can be years between when I work on technology or assess a mission option and when that technology or mission starts returning real science from space. Several of the instrument technologies I helped sponsor are now operating in space. When I worked in Earth Science I led the evaluation of several mission proposals, three of which are still operating (GRACE, CloudSat and CALIPSO). I feel a quiet sense of satisfaction when I see the new knowledge and useful results that come from things I helped make happen.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Look for a career, not just a job. Seek out work that you enjoy and believe in. This makes it far easier for you to get excited about and involved in the work you do, as well as be able to put in the extra effort needed to do well. A technical education is important, although it can be in any of a number of fields, as the main skill needed is the ability to understand complex problems and work them through to real solutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I enjoy spending time outdoors and I ride my bicycle to work most days (except when it is icy or during thunderstorms when there is a chance of getting hit by lightning). I also enjoy music. When I moved to the Washington, D.C. area I met people who play traditional Irish music, so I have taken up the fiddle.</p>\r\n",

From then on, whenever I came across anything having to do with space, science or technology, I was immediately interested and intrigued. It's incredible how much we've learned since that time; including the fact that Pluto is no longer considered a planet, making the very title of that book outdated.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin clearfix'></div>\n<div class='quote'>\n\"Science and math are important, but what's most important is to have a vision and a sustained source of personal motivation. Think often and deeply about what excites you and what you enjoy doing.\"\n</div>\n<footer>\n<cite>- Gregory Delory</cite>\n</footer>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin'></div>\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>How did you end up working in the space program? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I first became involved in space activities during high school. I won a contest to fly a student experiment on the Space Shuttle. This opportunity led to others, including a job at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I also chose to major in physics at the University of California, Berkeley. Studying physics gave me a tremendous degree of versatility. Physics spans basic science to technical topics and has helped me to work on a wide variety of space science projects and missions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I wasn't afraid to shoot for the Moon-- both literally and figuratively -- you never know until you try or ask. I also refuse to grow up -- so I just keep chasing my dreams each and every day.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As a younger person, my role models ranged from Albert Einstein and Carl Sagan to people like Chuck Yeager and John Glenn. These men and their attributes and focus are representative of my character to a degree: On the one hand I love the mystery and wonder of space science, but I also have a desire to carry it out in a very focused and practical manner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I've also admired entrepreneurial people like Richard Branson and Steve Jobs for showing that true success sometimes requires breaking the rules. Most recently, I've admired the progress that Elon Musk has been able to achieve with SpaceX.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is a Deputy Project Scientist? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As deputy project scientist I work with the project scientist of the Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE) mission. Together we make certain that the LADEE mission will fulfill its science objectives. This involves having a working understanding of the entire LADEE mission -- from the science instruments, launch vehicle and trajectory, all the way down to the ground system. We make sure that the top level requirements are managed and implemented throughout this system. We also make certain that the resulting science data will be processed and made available to the community for analysis and interpretation.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career. </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My favorite moment has to be launching my first sounding rocket experiment out of Poker Flats, Alaska. After working on the experiments and hardware for years, it was such a rewarding moment. I was able to use data from that flight to complete my graduate thesis in experimental space science.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It's a given that you can get into a good school, work hard and do well. However, what's more important is to get actively involved in projects that produce something that has a clear result at the end. For example, an experiment or space mission. These types of experiences will teach you resourcefulness, perseverance, teamwork, and leadership. Get your fingernails dirty, early and often -- you'll learn things that school will never teach you. All other things being equal, these experiences will set you apart from other students, and especially when it comes to getting a job working on exciting new space projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I'm a new dad so spending precious time with my family and young boy is the most important thing I do outside of work: we go to the zoo, playgrounds and have play-dates with other parents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am also an avid runner and weightlifter. Whenever I can, I like to enjoy the diversity of concerts, museums and cultural events found throughout the San Francisco Bay area.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Science and math are important, but what's most important is to have a vision and a sustained source of personal motivation. Think often and deeply about what excites you and what you enjoy doing. Science and math are what accounting is to a new business; you need to have the idea and vision first, and then the technical side comes in to make sure it all adds up. Focus on the former, and don't get lost in the details of the latter.</p>\r\n",

Of course I enjoyed reading science magazines, and watching scientific television shows. I had fish tanks and lizards as a kid, and I was always fascinated with astronomy. There was no doubt in my mind that I was going to be a scientist.

This was back in the seventies and at that time there was a lot of money available to schools for the study of astronomy. My school had its own planetarium, and it was the director of this planetarium who inspired me in the study of astronomy.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is an Institute Scientist? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As an Institute Scientist I perform numerical simulations on the formation and the evolution of the solar system. I also do a lot of work with Kuiper Belt objects. How I got interested in these objects in the first place was because I was trying to understand where a particular kind of comet called the <i>Jupiter Family Comet</i> came from because these comets have strange orbits. Since these comets are active and their orbits are bizarre we can get a lot of information on their chemical make-up and how they formed. And by learning about their chemistry we learn about the protoplanetary disk. We want to understand where we came from, where the water on Earth came from, the volatiles, the organics, and to do that we need to look out in the solar system to figure this out.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career. </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There are so many. It would be hard to pick just one. The joy of discovering something no one has known before, and to be able to sit in your office and tell yourself: \"I am the first person in history to know this little piece of information.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perhaps one favorite could be my work on the <i>Nice Model</i> of the solar system. We proposed that the planets formed in a much more compact configuration and that the planets started crossing one another. Uranus and Neptune got scattered out by Jupiter and Saturn and then evolved into their current orbits due to the gravitational interactions with the disk of particles. And when we realized that this model actually worked it was a really exciting moment. It was an idea that no one had really thought of before and it changed the whole community's perspective on how the planets formed and how they moved in these violent events.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Be a physics major as an undergraduate and then perhaps go into astronomy as a graduate student. Somebody once gave me that advice and it worked out for me.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My main hobby is working on my small collection of antique cars (when I have the time, of course). I used to take them to car shows too. I find that I need to do things with my hands rather than spend all my day sitting in front of a computer. So fixing cars is probably the thing I do to relax, even though it sometimes can be frustrating.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>You have to like the process. Being just interested in the science is not enough. You have to enjoy the nuts and bolts of science; otherwise you won't enjoy going to work every day.</p>\r\n",

Mars was visible in the night sky, and as I prepared to relieve the off-going watch, I realized that it provided a perfect check against our electronic navigation systems. Every night that I went to the bridge, I would look quickly to see that Mars was visible off the bow, knowing that if it wasn't, there might be a problem with our navigation. That ritual brought a personal connection to space and the stars that has been a part of maritime navigation since people first ventured out to sea, and persists even today as electronic aids become increasingly sophisticated and widespread.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin clearfix'></div>\n<div class='quote'>\nEvery night that I went to the bridge, I would look quickly to see that Mars was visible off the bow, knowing that if it wasn&rsquo;t, there might be a problem with our navigation.\n</div>\n<footer>\n<cite>- Photo of Ian Brosnan.</cite>\n</footer>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin'></div>\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>How did you end up working in the space program?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Although I have always been interested in NASA, it was happenstance that I started working for the Agency. I left the Coast Guard to pursue a Ph.D. in marine science, and when I finished there was an opportunity to apply to a new Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) program within the Presidential Management Fellowship (PMF), an idea that was initiated by NASA. I knew that I wanted a career in the Federal Government, and the Earth Science Division at Ames Research Center happened to need someone with my combination of managerial and technical experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is a STEM Presidential Management Fellow?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>That is a good question! The program is very new, and my cohort was the first. Obviously, a big part of the job is learning as much as I can about the NASA, but the PMF program is about developing managers in the U.S. Government. So far, I have helped lead an effort to move the U.S. Geological Survey's Menlo Park campus onto the NASA Ames Research Center campus, as well as a strategic planning activity for the Earth Science Division. During a detail to the USGS, I created a leadership development program for the 300 or so mid-level staff in the Pacific Region. I've also squeezed in a little time for science, including panel reviews for NASA, publishing, and a collaboration to build a new ocean science instrument.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career.</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I was fortunate in the Coast Guard to be selected for command-at-sea, and the day that I took command of my ship, the COBIA, has to be my favorite moment. However, turning her over to her new Captain after two successful years was, perhaps, more satisfying.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Science and naval service have run in my family for generations, and I have been inspired by my parents who have had successful scientific careers, and my grandfather who was a Royal Navy Coastal Forces officer during the Second World War. I have also drawn a lot of inspiration from Captain James Cook. He led three voyages to the remotest parts of the globe in the late 1700s and made significant contributions to science, seamanship and naval leadership.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Be curious, persistent, and personable. Strive to deliver the best work that you can, and don't be afraid of the occasional failure (but be prepared to learn from it).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I love being on the ocean and will kayak, surf or sail any chance that I get.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Take challenging classes in physics, chemistry, biology and mathematics, and also scientific programming. Simultaneously, seek opportunities to actually do science. Get into the field and the lab. This experience is as valuable as the classroom education, and it will give you context for what you are learning. Take the time while you are in school to enjoy some non-science classes as well. If this all sounds like a lot of hard work, it is. So, you will also need to take some downtime to relax and recharge (do not underestimate the value of that time!).</p>\r\n",

In the late 1940s, while in graduate school at the University of Chicago, Hibbs and his then roommate Roy Walford took some time off to \"break the bank\" in Reno and Las Vegas by exploiting the mechanical quirks of certain roulette wheels. This earned them a story in <i>Life</i> magazine. Their winnings financed a 40-foot sailboat and a year and a half of roaming the Caribbean. Hibbs obtained a master's degree in mathematics from the University of Chicago in 1947.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Roy Walford went on to become a leading gerontologist and Hibbs became a leader in exploring our solar system, as well as the \"Voice of JPL.\" \"I wanted to conquer space.

As JPL's head of the Research and Analysis Section, he was the systems designer for America's first successful satellite, Explorer 1, in 1958.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Later that year, when JPL became part of the newly formed NASA, Hibbs helped draw up JPL's master plan to explore the solar system with unmanned spacecraft. His gift for explaining difficult science in lay terms led to his position as the radio and television chronicler for the Ranger and Surveyor missions to the Moon in the 1960s; the Mariner missions to Venus, Mars and Mercury in the 1960s and 1970s; the Viking missions to Mars in the 1970s; and the Voyager missions to the outer solar system in the 1970s and 1980s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After helping to set up JPL's Space Science Division from 1960 to 1962, and serving as its first chief, Hibbs went on loan as a staff scientist for the United States Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, studying how arms control treaties could be monitored from space.

      "body": "<p>Bruce C. Murray <span>(1931-2013),</span> the Caltech professor of planetary science and geology who served as director of JPL from 1976 to 1982, died Aug. 29 at the age of 81. Murray was JPL's director during the Viking landings on Mars and the early missions of Voyager 1 and 2 as the twin spacecraft flew by Jupiter and Saturn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As director, Murray faced a rapidly shrinking budget as NASA's priorities solidified around the space shuttle and its focus on taking astronauts and payloads to low Earth orbit. As the agency cut back its planetary program, he gained a substantial expansion of JPL's civil affairs program with a large solar energy research project funded by the Department of Energy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Murray also waged political battles in Washington to save the planetary program - and JPL. In 1979, Murray joined with the late astronomer Carl Sagan and engineer Louis Friedman to found the Planetary Society, a membership-based nonprofit organization dedicated to exploring the solar system and expanding public advocacy for space exploration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Murray salvaged for JPL the Galileo mission to Jupiter, but lost the American half of the two-satellite International Solar Polar Mission (eventually launched with JPL instruments as the European Space Agency's Ulysses by space shuttle Discovery) and a proposed U.S. mission to Halley's comet. Murray also brought the American portion of the joint Netherlands/United Kingdom/U.S. Infrared Astronomy Satellite to JPL, and Caltech gained the project's science data center.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the midst of budget cuts in 1981, Murray struck a defiant note in an interview with Discover magazine. \"We're sitting here watching the coffin being nailed shut, and what's inside is imagination and vision,\" he told the publication. \"I wasn't appointed director to preside over the dissolution of the U.S. space exploration program ... I'm not going to be squeezed down to nothing.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During Murray's leadership, JPL launched Seasat, one of the earliest Earth-observing satellites; the Solar Mesosphere Explorer, an Earth-orbiting spacecraft that investigated the ozone in Earth's upper atmosphere; and Shuttle Imaging Radar-A, designed to fly aboard Space Shuttle Columbia as the first instrument that imaged Earth using radar pulses, rather than optical light, as illumination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A strong advocate of planetary exploration, Murray disagreed with the focus of the Viking missions - the search for life on Mars - because he saw it as premature, thinking that without an adequate understanding of Martian surface chemistry, the biological instruments would not be able to provide unambiguous results.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After earning a Ph.D. in geology at MIT in 1955, Murray worked as a geologist for Standard Oil until 1958, then served two years in the U.S. Air Force. He came to Caltech in 1960, initially working in planetary astronomy, and soon became part of the imaging science team for JPL's first two missions to Mars, Mariners 3 and 4. He served a similar role on Mariners 6, 7 and 9, using their imagery to begin constructing a geologic history for Mars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Murray published more than 130 scientific papers and authored or co-authored seven books. After he retired as director in late 1982 Murray returned to Caltech's Geological and Planetary Sciences Division, and was later named an emeritus professor at the campus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Murray is survived by his wife, Suzanne Moss, five children and grandchildren.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>Media contacts:<br />\r\nJane Platt (818) 354-0880<br />\r\nJet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.</p>\r\n",

The cornerstone for the new Center was unveiled during the dedication ceremony.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"Carl was an incredible visionary, and now his legacy can be preserved and advanced by a 2lst century research and education laboratory committed to enhancing our understanding of life in the universe and furthering the cause of space exploration for all time,\" said NASA Administrator Daniel Goldin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Sagan Center will be located in the planned NASA Research Park at Moffett Field, California, adjacent to the NASA Ames Research Center. As currently planned, the project could include approximately 700,000 square feet of new construction on more than 21 acres. The Sagan Center will consist of three 30,000-square-foot laboratory modules, with the potential to add a fourth module at a later date. The Center will also house a 30,000-square-foot public gallery exhibition area and a 500-seat auditorium.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Sagan Center will be a huge step forward toward NASA's goal of developing a world-class, shared-use research and development campus in association with academia, industry and non-profits. The Center is specifically designed to increase the interplay of scientists in fields for which there is no obvious common ground. The modular design of the planned laboratories will provide the necessary flexibility for future change and evolution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Research at the facility will focus on the many questions facing astrobiologists about life on Earth and in the Universe. A genomics and microbiology laboratory will be used to understand the fundamental processes of living systems in a variety of different environments. A biosensors facility will work on developing devices to study the fingerprints of life, both here on Earth and on other planets. A nanotechnology laboratory will be used to develop tiny devices that mimic or replicate the processes in living systems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"The Carl Sagan Center will provide an exceptional opportunity for leading-edge, multi-disciplinary research in support of NASA's mission to understand 'are we alone in the universe?,'\" said NASA Ames Deputy Director for Research Scott Hubbard. \"Scientists will conduct both basic and applied work that will further our understanding of life's origins, evolution and future.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"No honor would have meant more to Carl than this,\" said Ann Druyan, his wife and collaborator for 20 years. \"He loved NASA, cherished his relationship with Ames, and dreamed that we, as a civilization, would turn our genius to the deep questions of life in the cosmos.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>Carl Sagan (1934 - 1996) played a leading role in the American space program from its very beginning. He was a consultant and adviser to NASA beginning in the 1950s -- he briefed the Apollo astronauts before their flights to the Moon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Carl was born in New York City on November 9, 1934. He described himself as a childhood science fiction addict who became fascinated by astronomy when he learned that every star in the night sky was a distant Sun. He was always encouraged by his parents to research answers to his innumerable questions about science. His scientific curiosity led him to earn four degrees in physics, astronomy and astrophysics from the University of Chicago.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin clearfix'></div>\n<div class='quote'>\n\"Imagination will often carry us to worlds that never were. But without it we go nowhere.\"\n</div>\n<footer>\n<cite>- Carl Sagan</cite>\n</footer>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin'></div>\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>In his role as a visiting scientist at the <a href='http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/' target='_blank'>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</a> (JPL) in Pasadena, Calif., Carl helped design and manage the Mariner 2 mission to Venus, the Mariner 9 and Viking 1 and Viking 2 trips to Mars; the Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 missions to the outer solar system and the Galileo mission to Jupiter. Carl's research helped to solve the mysteries of the high temperature of Venus (a massive greenhouse effect), the seasonal changes on Mars (windblown dust) and the reddish haze of Titan (complex organic molecules).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Carl was often described as \"the scientist who made the Universe clearer to the ordinary person.\" He helped to popularize science through the writing of hundreds of articles and over two dozen books. He won a Pulitzer Prize in 1975 for his book \"The Dragons of Eden.\" His television series \"Cosmos\" was one of the most watched shows in public television history. It was seen by more than 500 million people in 60 different countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Carl taught and conducted research at Harvard University. In 1968, Carl became a professor at Cornell University where he was also the director of the Laboratory for Planetary Studies. He was well known as a pioneer in the field of exobiology, which is the study of the possibility of extraterrestrial life. He was among the first to determine that life could have existed on Mars. And he constantly appealed to NASA to extend its exploration of the Universe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With Louis Friedman and Bruce Murray, Carl founded The Planetary Society, a public membership organization, in 1980 which inspires, informs, and involves the public in the wonders of space exploration. The organization is also instrumental in influencing government decisions regarding spaceflight funding through its grassroots campaigns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"Carl was one of the greatest intellects behind the genesis of space exploration generally and specifically the Galileo mission,\" said Dr. Torrence Johnson, a Galileo mission team member. \"He was part of the original group that got together to promote the mission to NASA and he served as an interdisciplinary scientists on the mission team from the beginning. He was a great human being who shared with everyone his excitement about the exploration of the Universe.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Carl suffered from a rare bone marrow disease called myelodysplasia. Complications from this disease caused the pneumonia which ended his life on December 20, 1996. He was 62.</p>\r\n",

The Pioneer Office was the first and most successful spacecraft project office ever established at Ames. During its 18 years of existence, 12 spacecraft were launched by the office, which contributed to the success of subsequent Ames' space projects, including the Galileo Probe and Lunar Prospector.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin clearfix'></div>\n<div class='quote'>\n\"Charlie Hall's Pioneer 10 craft may be billions of miles from Earth, but his spirit will always be with us at NASA.\"\n</div>\n<footer>\n<cite>- <span>Daniel S.

Goldin said in 1999. \"His intelligence, persistence and leadership throughout his career at NASA - and particularly as the original Program Manager for the Pioneer Project - continue to inspire us to reach to the stars and beyond. Charlie Hall's Pioneer 10 craft may be over 6.8 billion miles from Earth, but his spirit will always be with us at NASA.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under Charlie's leadership, the Pioneer Project Office managed the development of and operated the Pioneer 6-9 series of Solar Wind Observatories, the Pioneer 10 and 11 Interplanetary Spacecraft, and the Pioneer Venus Orbiter, Bus and Entry probes. The spacecraft produced an outstanding record of technical accomplishments, including: first Solar Wind Observatories (Pioneer 6-9) which produced useable data for over 30 years; first spacecraft to traverse the asteroid belt (Pioneer 10); first spacecraft to fly-by Jupiter (Pioneer 10); first spacecraft to fly-by Saturn (Pioneer 11); coordinated Orbiter, Bus and Entry Probe measurements of Venus' atmosphere.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A native of San Francisco, Charlie graduated cum laude in 1942 from the University of California at Berkeley with a Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering. He joined NASA's predecessor agency, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) in May of 1942. Charlie resided in Palo Alto, CA for 7 years before moving to Los Altos, CA in 1950.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During his NACA career, Charlie made important research contributions to aeronautics, including performance improvements for the P-51 fighter and increased efficiency of swept-back wings. He also contributed to the development of conically cambered wings to improve the lift-to-drag ratio of delta-wing aircraft.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Soon after NASA was formed, Charlie helped persuade the Agency to develop the Pioneer 6-9 series of spacecraft, which examined the solar environment from orbits separate from the Earth's. Under his leadership, the reliability of spacecraft far exceeded performance requirements and resulted in more than 25 years of service from Pioneer 6.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"Space exploration projects managed by Charles Hall were executed with outstanding performance and economy, bringing world attention to Ames Research Center for its accomplishments,\" Ames Research Center Director Dr. Henry McDonald said in 1999. \"Ames quickly became a major participant in NASA's space exploration because of the excellence of his Pioneer interplanetary probes.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under Charlie's management, the first mission into space beyond Mars, the Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11 projects, completed a successful inspection of Jupiter. Pioneer 11 became the first spacecraft to reach Saturn. Instruments aboard Pioneer 10 and 11 conducted valuable scientific research over the next two decades about the sun's influence in this part of the galaxy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Charlie also managed Pioneer Venus, consisting of an orbiter and a set of four probes that were sent into Venus' atmosphere. In addition to nearly perfect engineering and many scientific accomplishments, the Pioneer Venus project was completed within its budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During his career, Charlie received numerous national and international awards for his role in NASA's early space exploration. He received two NASA Distinguished Service Medals, one for the Pioneer 10 Project and one for the Pioneer Venus Project. In 1974, Charlie received the American Astronautic Society, Inc., Achievement Award and in 1976, he received a Special Achievement Award from the National Civil Service League. The National Space Club selected him for an Astronautics Engineer of the Year Award in 1979. The following year, Charlie received the American Institute of Astronautics and Aeronautics (AIAA) Space Systems Award. Charlie also was selected for the NASA Ames Hall of Fame, which was established this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"Charles Hall was nominated for Ames' Hall of Fame for his personal brilliance and dedication in establishing management techniques and in guiding development of the Pioneer series of projects through complex technical challenges,\" said William Berry, deputy center director at NASA Ames in 1999. \"In spite of his tight controls on resources, he consistently enjoyed the highest esteem of each of the many world-class scientists whose instruments and studies were developed and supported via his spacecraft and management. His accomplishments are legendary among space project managers.\"</p>\r\n",

I'm not posting this to seek personal sympathy but instead to remind you all -- especially this week as a spacecraft flies past Pluto -- that exploration is a human endeavor and it lives and dies by the people who put their life's work into it, people who largely remain invisible but who leave an indelible mark on our understanding of the universe regardless. And people whose stories will be lost if we don't tell them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So whether you knew her or not, please take the time today to donate to breast cancer research and hug a survivor you know a little tighter. The solar system will be a little dimmer without her but it is still glimmering in the light she already shed. And we are all grateful.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-<b>Janet A. Vertesi, Asst. Prof. of Sociology at Princeton University</b></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<h3><b>In Her Own Words</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A few years ago, Claudia sat down and answered questions about her life and career as part of her longtime goal of inspiring young people&mdash;especially young women&mdash;to seek careers in science, technology, engineering and math.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Where are you from?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I was born in Canada, but grew up in a sleepy little community of orchards and oak trees called Santa Clara, Calif.&mdash;the center of the Silicon Valley. I grew up during the whole computer revolution that was happening there. (My mother used to work for Gordon Moore at Intel.)</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Describe the first time you made a personal connection with outer space.</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It wasn't exactly a connection with outer space, but at the age of 5 or 6, the film \"Fantasia\" opened an imaginative pathway of wonder for me about worlds other than Earth&mdash;primitive worlds&mdash;and how huge geologic forces can impact life forms there.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin clearfix'></div>\n<div class='quote'>\n\"Science and math are fascinating and fundamental.

I really wanted to go to the University of California at Berkeley (UCB), but my parents would only agree to pay for it if I majored in something \"useful\" like engineering. I hated engineering. But during an engineering internship at <a href='http://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/home/index.html' target='_blank'>NASA-Ames Research Center</a> (ARC), I found myself sneaking over to the space building all the time. When my boss realized that I enjoyed spending my time there, he placed me with a scientist (Dr. Ray T. Reynolds) in the Space Science Division. That's how it happened!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is a Project Scientist?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A project scientist is a key individual on the management staff of a mission. He or she has enough interdisciplinary experience to understand the science across multiple instruments, and helps to adjudicate and make key science decisions when there is conflict about how, when or who will make observations of a comet or any other science targets such as Mars or asteroids.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career. </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We were watching the first data come down from the Galileo mission's first encounter with Jupiter's moon Ganymede, and the data clearly showed the presence of some sort of ionosphere (a very thin atmosphere, which we now call a \"surface bound exosphere\") in the region. When I saw this evidence, I burst out saying \"I don't believe it!\" (I had, up until that time, done a lot of modeling work to prove that the moon was frozen solid.) The presence of a little bit of atmosphere meant that we needed to re-think our past assumptions concerning Ganymede as an undisturbed, pristine and inactive moon. It was an exciting moment to experience something that changed my whole way of thinking. I've never been so happy to be wrong before!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Carl Sagan inspired me through his television series \"Cosmos.\" (I must have watched the series a dozen times). President Kennedy also inspired me when he said \"... we will go into space, not because it is easy, but because it is hard ...\" And I am also inspired by great scientists of the past, like Johannes Kepler. Kepler struggled his whole life to make orbits circular, until he grasped a fundamental truth, that orbits are elliptical in nature. To be that dedicated to searching out a fundamental truth continues to inspire me.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>When deciding on your career you should be aware of the balance of work, personal satisfaction and financial rewards. In the early days of my career I would compare notes with an attorney friend of mine, and I found that each of us were working the same long hours, but she was making about three times as much money as me! Loving your work can sometimes be as important as how much money you make. As a woman it is really tough to make the balance of family time and science work successfully. You have to decide if you want to spend most of your time working at the expense of family time! Having the right partner is an important part of deciding on that balance.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I love to go horseback riding, and I write science fiction. One of my short stories got selected for publication by Dr. Fantastique's Books&mdash;it's a steampunk adaptation of Shakespeare's The Winter's Tale (set to be released in May 2012) called Leo's Mechanical Queen, part of a Shakespeare anthology that will go by the title: The Omnibus of Dr. Bill Shakes and the Magnificent Ionic Pentatetrameter. I'm so excited! Also, I released my personal website, finally, and hope to meet people in my Scientist's Caf? (forum) to talk about science, books, movies, and art in the news - and matters of multicultural interest.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Science and math are fascinating and fundamental. They require as much discipline to study and master as an athlete working to be a football player, or a musician attempting to land a recording contract. Hours and hours of practice go into the mastery of the field. But the rewards are just as terrific! Imagine being the first person to make a discovery, to have a mathematical principle named after you or to make the fundamental discoveries that take civilization to the next level? In the annals of history the athletes and musicians fade, but the ones who make fundamental improvements in humankind's way of life, and in their understanding of the Universe, live on in their discoveries.</p>\r\n",

McKay was the chief scientist for Astrobiology at the NASA Johnson Space Center. During the Apollo program, McKay gave the first men to walk on the Moon training in geology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In recent years, McKay was perhaps best known for being the first author of a scientific paper postulating past life on Mars on the basis of evidence in martian meteorite ALH 84001. This paper has become one of the most heavily cited papers in planetary science. The NASA Astrobiology Institute was founded partially as a result of community interest in this paper and related topics.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin clearfix'></div>\n<div class='quote'>\nMcKay studied lunar dust since the return of the first Apollo 11 samples in 1969, and has contributed over 200 publications on this topic.\n</div>\n<footer>\n<cite>- David McKay</cite>\n</footer>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin'></div>\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>As a graduate student in geology at Rice University, McKay was present at President John F. Kennedy's speech in 1962 announcing the goal of landing a man on the moon within the decade. Kennedy's speech inspired his interest in helping to train the Apollo astronauts in geology. He was a chief trainer for Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin during their last geology field trip in West Texas. On 20 July 1969, McKay was the only geologist present in the Apollo Mission Control Room in Houston when Armstrong and Aldrin walked on the moon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>McKay studied lunar dust since the return of the first Apollo 11 samples in 1969, and has contributed over 200 publications on this topic. As a result of this effort, McKay contributed major discoveries, including the source of vapor deposition on lunar soil grains, the formation of nanophase iron globules on lunar soil grains, the processes on the moon that contribute to grain size distribution, and insight into space weathering and the chemically activated nature of in situ lunar dust.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>McKay was honored by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) by having an asteroid named after him in 2002. His IAU citation mentions his years of work on lunar samples as well as the positive effect his research on Martian meteorites has had on planetary research. McKay was also a recipient of the Outstanding Graduate Student Award at Rice University, the NASA Superior Achievement Award for Lunar Science Contributions; the Laurels Award from Aviation Week and Space Technology, the NASA Exceptional Scientific Achievement Medal, and the Distinguished Texas Scientist Award from the Texas Academy of Science.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>McKay was with NASA for more than 47 years, and made substantial contributions to science during his career.

Wilkinson (1935 - 2002), a pioneer in physics and cosmology, lived and went to school in Michigan. He received both his B.S. and M.S. in Engineering and his Ph.D. in Physics from the University of Michigan before coming to Princeton University to become a professor of physics. Besides teaching graduate course in physics David made time to teach undergraduate courses as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"[David] particularly enjoyed teaching the Princeton undergraduate introductory physics courses; he had a flair for presenting physics demonstrations that kept the students on the edges of their seats, and as always he took pleasure in the students' reactions, which they in turn could sense and appreciate,\" said colleagues John Mather and Jim Peebles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"Dave's science often took the path less traveled, with results that have seeded large and active fields,\" said a 2003 memorial in Physics Today. \"He showed by example that the experimenter's conscience can be the best defense against bad science. Dave embodied so much of what we aspire to as scientists and as people. His effortless charm and natural affinity for people, his generosity with time, and his total absence of self-promotion, brought out the best in all who were privileged to know him.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While a professor at Princeton, David made many discoveries. From the mid-1960s on, David was involved in almost every effort of measuring the faint echoes of the Big Bang, starting with receivers on the top of the university's buildings, then balloons, and then satellites. One <i>echo</i> is known as Cosmic Microwave Background radiation (CMB), which is leftover heat from the formation of the Universe. David was instrumental in defining CMB research from the days of its discovery in 1964. This led to his work as a scientist on the Microwave Anisotropy Probe Instrument (MAP) 38 years later. This satellite was renamed the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) in his honor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WMAP was launched in June 2001, and observes the oldest light in the Universe (CMB).

He worked extremely hard himself, and he demanded the same dedication, devotion, seriousness from everybody around him. If they didn't give that, if they didn't perform, then they ran afoul of him. That applied to students; that applied to fellow faculty, technical associates, engineers, anybody around him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the same time he had a humorous side, a warm side, a personal side that was in some ways appealing. But he was very difficult to work for, or even in the same building with. He prided himself on knowing almost everything, or having access to people who did. There's funny things that linger on even in the new building over here. The entrance door on the side is always locked. I assume it's still locked. It certainly was from the get-go with him because he didn't want \"common people\" trafficking through his new building, and he would put it exactly that way: This is only for serious people who are doing what we're doing here, which is very serious, and everybody else, the public, just stay away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><h3>George Coyne</h3><br />\r\nHe was undoubtedly a great scientist. He was very, for want of a better word, authoritarian. He was of the European school of \"the professor says, and the students do what the professor says\" kind of thing. Though he loosened up quite a bit, I think.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He was not the easiest man to get along with. But he wished everybody well. I'll never forget one incident where a Polish astronomer had to leave Poland because the Russians were after him, or something or other. He came on a visit and then he had to go back. Gerard Kuiper set up a deal with him whereby if he sent a colored postcard, Kuiper had a position for him, a permanent position. If he sent just a black-and-white postcard, unfortunately that meant that he didn't have a position for him. Kuiper worked very hard to get this [position opened]. I worked with the guy for many years: Wieslaw Wisniewski.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So that was the kind of guy Kuiper was. Just those incidents describe him. He had to be very strong. He was starting a major effort here at the University of Arizona, so he had to kind of dominate the scene; and he attracted very good people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><h3>Alan Binder</h3><br />\r\nThere were only a handful of us, and one of the reasons I believe was very few people could tolerate being with Kuiper. Carl Sagan, Dale Cruikshank, Bill Hartmann, me, Toby Owen-there's less than a dozen people who can say, \"I studied under Kuiper.\" To me, it's all a matter of Darwinian evolution: Either you could stand being under him, or you couldn't. Very few people really could.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kuiper had very little interest in our education. We were there to work as assistants, and that's what we learned. We had 20-hour assistantships, and he would bawl us out if we worked less than 40 hours, saying we weren't taking our assistantships seriously. When he taught the few courses he did, he would be up there: \"How much longer do I have to be here?\" He did not like to teach. He did research, and anything that got in his way, he didn't want to do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dale and I worked in the infrared spectrometer lab; we built spectrometers and went on these two-week long observing runs three times a year, so you see how much time we spent away from class-and that was it. We learned by doing, and by listening to him. When you're on the observatory floor all night-and of course nowadays they don't do that, astronomers sit at home with their computer and they don't go up there-in my day I sat out there in the freezing night all night, and helped Kuiper, or did my own observations, later in my career. So you learned by being around Kuiper, not by formally having coursework and things like that. I would say, people who worked with Tom Gehrels had a different relationship, but those of us who were with Kuiper, it was pretty much that. You were on your own. You survived, or you didn't.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<h3><i>Gerard Kuiper, the astronomer for whom the Kuiper Belt beyond Neptune is named, died on 23 December 1973</i>.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Gerard Kuiper (1905 - 1973) is regarded by many as the father of modern planetary science. He is well known for his many discoveries, including:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*1947: He correctly predicted carbon dioxide is a major component of the atmosphere of <a href='PLANET:Mars' target='_blank'>Mars</a>.<br />\r\n*1947: He correctly predicted the rings of <a href='PLANET:Saturn' target='_blank'>Saturn</a> are composed of particles of ice.<br />\r\n*1947: He discovered <a href='PLANET:Ura_Miranda' target='_blank'>Miranda</a>, the fifth moon of <a href='PLANET:Uranus' target='_blank'>Uranus</a>.<br />\r\n*1949: He discovered <a href='PLANET:Nep_Nereid' target='_blank'>Nereid</a> orbiting <a href='PLANET:Neptune' target='_blank'>Neptune</a>.<br />\r\n*1949: He proposed an influential theory of the origin of our <a href='PLANET:SolarSys' target='_blank'>solar system</a>, suggesting that the planets had formed by the condensation of a large cloud of gas around the <a href='PLANET:Sun' target='_blank'>sun</a>.<br />\r\n*1951: He proposed the existence of what is now called the <a href='PLANET:KBOs' target='_blank'>Kuiper Belt</a>, a disk-shaped region of minor planets outside the orbit of Neptune, which also is a source of short-period comets.<br />\r\n*1956: He proved that Mars' polar icecaps are composed of frozen water and not of carbon dioxide as they had been previously assumed.<br />\r\n*1964: He predicted what the surface of the <a href='PLANET:Moon' target='_blank'>Moon</a> would be like to walk on -- \"like crunchy snow\". This was verified by astronaut Neil Armstrong in 1969.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"Kuiper studied the planets... at a time when they were scarcely of interest to other astronomers,\" said Dr. Bill McKinnon, a co-investigator on the New Horizons mission to explore the Kuiper Belt, the region of space named in Kuiper's honor. \"But with new telescopes and instrumentation, he showed that there were great things to discover, which is as true today as it was then.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gerard played an influential role in the development of infrared airborne astronomy in the 1960s and 1970s. In 1967 the NASA four engine jet Convair 990 aircraft with an onboard telescope became available for infrared studies at an altitude of 40,000 feet. Gerard used it extensively for spectroscopy of the sun, stars, and planets, discovering things about them that could not be found from ground-based observatories. The Kuiper Airborne Observatory (1974) was named in his honor, as were craters on the Moon, <a href='PLANET:Mercury' target='_blank'>Mercury</a> and Mars.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGerard was a demanding individual whose routine included hard work and long hours.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"He worked extremely hard himself, and he demanded the same dedication, devotion and seriousness from everybody around him,\" said scientist Dale Cruikshank. \"If they didn't give that, or if they didn't perform, they ran afoul of him. That applied to students. It also applied to fellow faculty, technical associates and engineers -- anybody around him. But at the same time, he had a humorous side, a warm side, a personal side that was in some ways appealing.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One hundred years after Gerard's birth, the New Horizons mission is on its way to the Kuiper Belt region of our solar system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"Kuiper was one of the first scientists to focus almost exclusively on exploring the properties of planets,\" said Dr. Richard Binzel, New Horizons co-investigator and professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). \"His work laid the foundation for the spacecraft missions of the late 20th and early 21st centuries.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gerard was born in the Netherlands in 1905 and was educated at Leiden University as an astronomer with a doctoral dissertation on binary stars. Gerard came to the United States in 1933 and obtained American citizenship in 1937.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He worked at Lick Observatory, Harvard, Yerkes Observatory of the University of Chicago and the University of Arizona. The Lunar and Planetary Laboratory, a research and educational unit in which many planetary scientists have been trained, was established under his guidance at the University of Arizona.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gerard died in 1973 from a heart attack while on vacation in Mexico with his wife, Sarah Fuller. He was 68.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><b>Read More:</b><br />\r\n*<a href='http://www.lpl.arizona.edu/history/kuiper.php' target='_blank'>Lunar and Planetary Lab's Kuiper Remembrance</a><br />\r\n*<a href='http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/' target='_blank'>New Horizons Mission Homepage</a></p>\r\n",

She argued that inherited variation, significant in evolution, does not come mainly from random mutations. Rather, new tissues, organs, and even new species evolve primarily through the long-lasting intimacy of strangers. The fusion of genomes in symbioses followed by natural selection, she suggests, leads to increasingly complex levels of individuality. Margulis was also acknowledged for her contribution to James E. Lovelock's Gaia concept. Gaia theory posits that the Earth's surface interactions among living beings sediment, air, and water have created a vast self-regulating system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"She leaves us a legacy of academic accomplishment brought about by her original thought and tireless inquiry into multiple fields of science that look at how the world functions and how that magnificent world has developed over time,\" said UMass Amherst Chancellor Robert C.

Her publications span topics from cell biology to microbial evolution. Margulis authored and co-authored hundreds of research papers, reviews, non-technical articles and many books, including \"Symbiotic Planet: A New Look at Evolution\" and \"Acquiring Genomes: A Theory of the Origin of the Species.\" Most recently, with UMass Amherst alumnus Michael J. Chapman, she wrote \"Kingdoms & Domains: An Illustrated Guide to the Phyla of Life on Earth.\" Several of her books were co-authored by her son, Dorion Sagan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1998, the Library of Congress announced that it would permanently archive her papers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1983 and received the National Medal of Science from President Bill Clinton in 1999.

A&rsquo;Hearn died May 29 at his home in University Park, Maryland at the age of 76.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A University of Maryland (UMD) astronomer and Distinguished University Professor, A&rsquo;Hearn was honored posthumously Monday at the Small Bodies Assessment Group (SBAG) meeting at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. The NASA Medal is for &ldquo;fundamental work on comets and small bodies of the solar system, leadership in space missions, and ensuring public access to data from NASA missions and related projects.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Mike A&rsquo;Hearn devoted his life to exploration, and his work has transformed our understanding of what comets are made of and how they interact within our corner of the universe,&rdquo; said Jim Green, director of NASA&rsquo;s Planetary Science Division, who presented the award to members of A&rsquo;Hearn&rsquo;s family. &ldquo;This is a great loss for the small bodies community and for me personally.&rdquo;  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>A'Hearn was most widely known as the principal investigator of NASA&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/deep-impact/\">Deep Impact</a> mission, which on July 4, 2005 released a washing-machine-sized probe that collided spectacularly with comet Tempel 1, while the main spacecraft observed the results. The powerful impact gave scientists their first-ever view of pristine material inside a comet and garnered huge public attention for planetary science, solar system exploration, NASA and the University of Maryland. The event set a then-NASA record for webpage hits (more than 1 million) and drew front page news coverage around the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A'Hearn and his science team then proposed that NASA use the surviving main spacecraft for continued comet studies. With A'Hearn as principal investigator, the Deep Impact craft flew by Earth and found water on the moon on its way to an extended mission, designated <a>EPOXI</a>, with dual purposes: studying extrasolar planets and comet Hartley 2. The Deep Impact spacecraft later imaged two other comets Garradd (2012) and ISON (2013).  The images and findings of these later missions further advanced comet science and attracted more media and public attention.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>When NASA lost contact with the Deep Impact spacecraft in September 2013, A&rsquo;Hearn said, &ldquo;Deep Impact has been a principal focus of my astronomy work for more than a decade and I&rsquo;m saddened by its functional loss. But, I&rsquo;m very proud of the many contributions to our evolving understanding of comets that it has made possible.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Illuminating the Primordial Dust from Whence We Came</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A&rsquo;Hearn&rsquo;s many scientific contributions started well before and continued well beyond Deep Impact. During his more than 50 years at UMD, he studied comets using ground-based observatories and space-based observatories such as the Hubble Space Telescope, as well as the Deep Impact and other spacecraft. A&rsquo;Hearn&rsquo;s work after Deep Impact included being co-investigator on NASA&rsquo;s Stardust-NExT mission to re-visit comet Tempel 1, and being a co-investigator on two instruments on ESA&rsquo;s Rosetta mission: the OSIRIS camera and the NASA ultraviolet spectrograph \"Alice.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Colleagues say another major contribution to planetary science was A'Hearn&rsquo;s nearly three decades as principal investigator for the Small Bodies Node, which is the part of NASA's <a href=\"https://pds.nasa.gov/\">Planetary Data System</a> (PDS) that specializes in the archiving, cataloging, and distributing of scientific data sets relevant to asteroids, comets and interplanetary dust. Under his leadership, the Small Bodies Node developed from a two-person group to a strong, UMD-based organization of 18 scientists and programmers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Defending Planet Earth</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A&rsquo;Hearn was also an avid sailor, who once said that his second choice of profession after astronomy would have been ship&rsquo;s captain. Another important part of his scientific work was helping in the detection of comets and asteroids orbiting in the &ldquo;uncharted waters&rdquo; of our solar system that could pose impact hazards to Earth and the living things she carries, and determining the best methods to prevent or mitigate such impacts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He was vice-chair of a 2010 National Academy of Sciences/National Research Council report entitled: <a href=\"https://www.nap.edu/catalog/12842/defending-planet-earth-near-earth-object-surveys-and-hazard-mitigation\">\"Defending Planet Earth: Near-Earth-Object Surveys and Hazard Mitigation Strategies (2010) Chapter: 2 Risk Analysis.&rdquo;</a> He also chaired the mitigation sub-panel that wrote the section of the report devoted to protecting our planet from dangerous &ldquo;near-Earth objects&rdquo; or mitigating the damage of unavoidable impacts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Said Lindley Johnson, NASA&rsquo;s planetary defense officer and program executive for Deep Impact/EPOXI, &ldquo;Mike was a joy to work with. Not only was he a treasured advisor to so many graduate students, he was a valued mentor to us all. I&rsquo;d like to think of him now as having grabbed a comet by its vibrant tail &ndash; forever riding it around the solar system.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>A Deep and Lasting Impact on Comet Science and Colleagues</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A'Hearn was named a Distinguished University Professor in 2000. This formal title denotes University of Maryland's academic honor of highest distinction and is awarded to a limited number of UMD's most accomplished professors. He also received the Gerard P. Kuiper Prize in 2008 from the American Astronomical Society Division for Planetary Sciences, which &ldquo;recognizes and honors outstanding contributors to planetary science.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A&rsquo;Hearn&rsquo;s impact on his field and the university was personal as well as professional. Colleagues say he was a great and thoughtful friend as well as a terrific teacher and mentor for younger scientists, many of whom now will continue his legacy by further advancing the understanding of comets and asteroids and the early history of our solar system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"It was such a privilege to work with Mike, both as his Ph.D. student and as a colleague in NASA&rsquo;s Near-Earth Object Observations Program,\" said Kelly Fast, the program's current manager. \"Mike&rsquo;s leadership of the Deep Impact and EPOXI missions and the Planetary Data System Small Bodies Node has left NASA an amazing legacy, in addition to his major contributions to cometary and small-body science. His passing is a great loss to NASA and to the planetary science community.\"</p>\r\n",

He was 83.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"Bob had been pushing for a Pluto mission since the early 1990s,\" said New Horizons Principal Investigator Alan Stern, of the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, \"and we worked closely together over many years to make that dream a reality.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A 50-year veteran of deep-space missions, Farquhar made pivotal contributions to the historic explorations of asteroids and comets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He joined the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) in 1990. During his 16 years at the Laboratory he applied his trajectory design skills, along with extensive space mission experience and unique insight, to a wide range of challenges in mission design and navigation. He played a key role in APL's initiatives to support deep space missions through NASA's Discovery program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most notably, he conceived, and was the flight director for, the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR) mission to 433 Eros - the first launch of the Discovery program. Launched in 1996, NEAR (later called NEAR-Shoemaker) reached Eros in February 2000 and became the first spacecraft to orbit, study and then - a year later - safely land on an asteroid. The mission answered many fundamental questions about the nature and origin of asteroids.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Farquhar went on to make critical contributions to other APL-led Discovery missions, including the Comet Nucleus Tour (CONTOUR), and the Mercury Surface, Space Environment, Geochemistry, and Ranging (MESSENGER) mission to the planet Mercury. He also served as the first mission manager for New Horizons, which, following a trajectory that Farquhar envisioned flew past dwarf planet Pluto and its family of small moons this past July.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"At heart, Bob was an inveterate dreamer: he wanted to expand the reach of humankind in the solar system,\" said Mike Ryschkewitsch, head of APL's Space Exploration Sector. \"Bob was a master of trajectory design and the use of gravity-assist flybys, particularly to reach challenging targets such as Mercury. The Discovery class MESSENGER mission to Mercury is largely a product of his trajectory design that incorporated multiple gravity assists to reach the inner solar system.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the more famous of Farquhar's pre-APL missions was the International Sun Earth Explorer-3, or ISEE-3, launched in August 1978 to study space weather. ISEE-3 was the first mission to exploit Farquhar's development of \"halo orbits\" around libration points, where the gravitational pull from two celestial bodies is balanced. After ISEE-3's initial mission was accomplished, Farquhar and long-time collaborator David Dunham designed an intricate series of orbits and engine firings that sent the spacecraft away from Earth to perform the first encounter with a comet. Renamed the International Cometary Explorer (ICE), the spacecraft made a textbook pass through the tail of comet Giacobini-Zinner on Sept. 11, 1985.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Farquhar was born in September 1932, and attended elementary and high school in Chicago. As a child, he became interested in aviation, often reading about it and building model airplanes of his own design. Prior to college, he joined the Army and served in Japan and Korea during the Korean War.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He studied aeronautical engineering at the University of Illinois and received his bachelor's degree with honors in 1959. His first studies of orbital mechanics coinciding with the launch of the first satellite, Sputnik. He went on to receive his master's degree from the University of California, Los Angeles, in 1961. He worked for a period of time at Lockheed Missiles and Space Company in Sunnyvale, Calif., and earned his Ph.D. from Stanford University in 1969.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From 1969 to 1990, he worked at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and NASA Headquarters in Washington, holding a number of positions that included studies of post-Apollo lunar exploration concepts, the lunar shuttle transportation system, and key management positions for numerous satellite projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Farquhar was bestowed numerous honors and awards from the military, NASA, and a variety of space organizations and associations, and had written, co-written or contributed to over 200 publications. He is survived by his wife, Irina, stepdaughter, Anya, and a host of relatives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"New Horizons bids a fond farewell to its good friend and colleague, but the team will never forget Bob's many contributions to the success of the New Horizons mission to Pluto,\" said New Horizons Project Scientist Hal Weaver, of APL.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>Robert Farquhar (1932-2015) was a visionary and expert in planetary exploration, spacecraft design, and celestial navigation at NASA and the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory. and KinetX, Inc., He died in October 2015 at the age of 83.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A 50-year veteran of deep space missions and often referred to as a genius in his field, Farquhar made pivotal contributions to deep space missions to asteroids and comets.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin clearfix'></div>\n<div class='quote'>\n\"At heart, Bob was an inveterate dreamer: he wanted to expand the reach of humankind in the solar system.

From 1961-1964, he worked at the Lockheed Missiles and Space Company in California, perfecting orbital dynamics and control of satellites while also assisting in the preparation of an Interplanetary Flight Handbook for NASA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From 1969-1990, he was employed at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland and NASA Headquarters in Washington. He held a number of positions that included studies of post-Apollo lunar exploration concepts, the lunar shuttle transportation system, in addition to key management positions for numerous satellite projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At APL from 1990-2007, he conceived, and was the flight director, for the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR) mission to the asteroid named Eros. Launched in 1996, NEAR (later called NEAR-Shoemaker) was the first spacecraft to orbit and perform an in-depth investigation of an asteroid, and then safely land on it in February 2001. Thanks to Farquhar's efforts, the mission answered many fundamental questions about the nature and origin of asteroids.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also while at APL, he helped lead the Comet Nucleus Tour (CONTOUR) mission; the Mercury Surface, Space Environment, Geochemistry, and Ranging (MESSENGER) mission to the planet Mercury; and the New Horizons mission to the dwarf planet Pluto, and its moon, Charon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also among Farquhar's career highlights was the International Sun-Earth Explorer/International Cometary Explorer (ISEE-3/ICE) mission. As the mission's flight director, Farquhar led the crew that placed ISEE-3 in a \"halo orbit\" around the gravitational balancing or libration point between the sun and the Earth. He designed the quintuple lunar flyby trajectory that sent the spacecraft through the tail of the P/Giacobini-Zinner comet in September 1985. Farquhar invented this trajectory that allowed the U.S. to become the first nation to encounter a comet. Farquhar's knowledge of halo orbits, a term that he had coined in his 1969 dissertation at Stanford University, was critical in calculating the trajectory for the successful mission.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Born in September 1932, Farquhar attended elementary and high school in Chicago. As a child, he became interested in aviation, often reading about it and building model airplanes of his own design.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Farquhar attended college briefly before joining the army in April 1951. He completed basic training at Fort Knox and jump training at Fort Benning before being deployed to Fort Bragg as part of the 82nd Airborne Division.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In late 1952 Farquhar requested to be transferred to a division which was taking part in the Korean War, being deployed to the 187th Infantry Regiment stationed in Japan. After some training in Japan, Farquhar was invited to attend clerk typist school and became the company clerk, writing reports, for some time. One day, after some North Korean prisoners were released, Farquhar's division was moved to Kimpo airfield for one month. There, he was on the front lines until the ceasefire.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Returning to the U.S., Farquhar attended the University of Illinois Navy Pier campus before moving to the main campus at Champaign in 1957. There he decided on a career in spaceflight, finishing his bachelor's degree in aeronautical engineering in 1959. He stayed at the University of Illinois for graduate school before applying and being accepted for a position at the University of California, Los Angeles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During his summer after graduating Farquhar worked at the RAND Corporation in California. He completed his engineering master's degree at the University of California and attended Stanford University for his PhD in astronautics which he obtained in 1968, working with John Breakwell to develop halo orbit and other libration point trajectory concepts and applications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Farquhar was bestowed numerous honors and awards from the military, NASA, and a variety of space organizations and associations. Farquhar wrote the book, \"Fifty Years on the Space Frontier: Halo Orbits, Comets, Asteroids, and More\", voted the best book of the year by the International Academy of Astronautics, and has written, co-written or contributed to over 200 other publications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He is survived by his wife Irina, step-daughter Anya, and a host of relatives.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><br />\r\n*<a href='https://www.aip.org/history-programs/niels-bohr-library/oral-histories/33722-1' target='_blank'>American Institute of Physics: Robert Farquhar Oral History Interview</a><br />\r\n*<a href='http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/common/content/videos/interviews/Farquhar11a_640x360.mp4' target='_blank'>Listen to Bob Describe New Horizons' Journey to Pluto in 2006</a><br />\r\n*<a href='http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/common/content/videos/interviews/Farquhar11b_640x360.mp4' target='_blank'>Listen to Bob Describe New Horizons' Science Goals in 2006</a></p>\r\n",

      "body": "<p><b>Official NASA Statement on Dr. Ride's Passing</b><br />\r\nIn a space agency filled with trailblazers, Sally K. Ride was a pioneer of a different sort. The soft-spoken California physicist broke the gender barrier 29 years ago when she rode to orbit aboard space shuttle Challenger to become America's first woman in space.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\"Sally Ride broke barriers with grace and professionalism -- and literally changed the face of America's space program,\" said NASA Administrator Charles Bolden. \"The nation has lost one of its finest leaders, teachers and explorers. Our thoughts and prayers are with Sally's family and the many she inspired. She will be missed, but her star will always shine brightly.\"<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\"Sally was a personal and professional role model to me and thousands of women around the world,\" said NASA Deputy Administrator Lori Garver. \"Her spirit and determination will continue to be an inspiration for women everywhere.\"<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRide's contribution to America's space program continued right up until her death at age 61 this week. After two trips to orbit aboard the shuttle, she went on to an award-winning academic career at the University of California, San Diego, where her expertise and wisdom were widely sought on matters related to space. She holds the distinction of being the only person to serve as a member of both investigation boards following NASA's two space shuttle accidents. She also served as a member of the Review of U.S. Human Spaceflight Plans Committee in 2009 which informed many of the decisions about NASA's current human spaceflight programs.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, Ride's place in history was assured on June 18, 1983 when she rocketed into space on Challenger's STS-7 mission with four male crewmates.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\"The fact that I was going to be the first American woman to go into space carried huge expectations along with it,\" Ride recalled in an interview for the 25th anniversary of her flight in 2008. \"That was made pretty clear the day that I was told I was selected as a crew. I was taken up to Chris Kraft's office. He wanted to have a chat with me and make sure I knew what I was getting into before I went on the crew. I was so dazzled to be on the crew and go into space I remembered very little of what he said.\"<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\"On launch day, there was so much excitement and so much happening around us in crew quarters, even on the way to the launch pad,\" Ride said. \"I didn't really think about it that much at the time -- but I came to appreciate what an honor it was to be selected to be the first to get a chance to go into space.\"<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRide joined NASA as part of the 1978 astronaut class, the first to include women. She and five other women, along with 29 men, were selected out of 8,000 applicants. The class became known as the \"Thirty-Five New Guys\" and reported to the Johnson Space Center the next summer to begin training. Ride trained for five years before she and three of her classmates were assigned to STS-7. The six-day mission deployed two communications satellites and performed a number of science experiments.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFollowing that historic flight, Ride returned to space on another shuttle mission, STS-41G in 1984. The 8-day mission deployed the Earth Radiation Budget Satellite, conducted scientific observations of Earth, and demonstrated potential satellite refueling techniques. She was assigned to a third flight, but transitioned to a role on the Rogers Commission that investigated the Challenger accident after that shuttle was lost in January 1986. When the investigation was completed, she accepted a job as a special assistant to the NASA administrator for long range and strategic planning.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRide left NASA in 1989 to join the faculty at the University of California, San Diego, as a professor of physics and director of the University of California's California Space Institute. In 2001, she founded her own company, Sally Ride Science, to pursue her long-time passion of motivating girls and young women to pursue careers in science, math and technology.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA native of Los Angeles, Ride graduated from high school there in 1968 and enrolled at Stanford University. At Stanford, she earned four degrees, including a doctorate in physics in 1978. She also was an accomplished athlete who played varsity tennis at Stanford after being nationally ranked as a youth.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRide received numerous honors and awards during the course of her career. Most notably, she was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame and the Astronaut Hall of Fame, and received the Jefferson Award for Public Service, the von Braun Award, the Lindbergh Eagle, and the NCAA's Theodore Roosevelt Award.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><br />\r\n<b>Maria Zuber, Principal Investigator for NASA's GRAIL Mission</b><br />\r\nI knew Sally Ride. I feel very fortunate to make that statement. It is a statement that I am confident that can be made by many because Sally shared the best part of her - her love of science and education, with so very many.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like most, I first met Sally via the media as she trained to become one of America's first females in space. When she flew STS-7, and became our first woman in space, I followed along and secretly wished I were her. But the reality is, no one could be Sally Ride but Sally Ride. I found that out when I had the opportunity to meet her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was about 10 years ago. Back then Sally had finished her NASA career and was starting up Sally Ride Science. We were both speaking at a science festival Sally's company put together to inspire young women to pursue a future in the sciences. It was Sally's name that got more than 1,000 girls there that day, but it was her boundless enthusiasm and passion for the unknown - and communicating how her young audience could play an important role in making those unknowns known, that held their attention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We built a friendship that day. When I went on to become chief scientist on my own space mission, one of the first calls I made was to Sally, asking her if she and her team could bottle that focused, scientifically-driven fire and launch it aboard our twin lunar orbiters. Before she spoke I already knew the answer. It was the kind of challenge Sally loved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the GRAIL mission launched in September of last year, Sally's vision, called MoonKAM, flew with it. With MoonKAM, middle-school students could literally take charge of a camera aboard a NASA spacecraft and command it to take pictures of the lunar surface. By the time these students received their own pictures from 240,000 miles away, they received something even more valuable - a knowledge of the moon, space and an appreciation for our place in the cosmos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am certainly sad for the loss of my friend. But what sadness I feel today is tempered by the pride that I have in knowing her, and learning from her. And when I think of that, and I consider the thousands upon thousands of others that Sally had personally touched and motivated through the decades, it makes me look to the future and wonder where the spirit of Sally Ride will show up next.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Maria Zuber</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<div class='center image_module' style=''>\n<figure class='inline_figure'>\n<img alt='' src='/images/content/EMBED:http://www.youtube.com/embed/t8vtDvbOMiY'>\n</figure>\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Astronaut Steve Hawley</b><br />\r\n\"Sally was a very private person who found herself a very public persona. It was a role in which she was never fully comfortable. I was privileged to be a part of her life and be in a position to support her as she became the first American woman to fly in space.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While she never enjoyed being a celebrity, she recognized that it gave her the opportunity to encourage children, particularly young girls, to reach their full potential.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sally Ride, the astronaut and the person, allowed many young girls across the world to believe they could achieve anything if they studied and worked hard. I think she would be pleased with that legacy.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<h2><b>In her own words:</b></h2>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Where are you from? </b><br />\r\nI am from Los Angeles, Calif.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Describe the first time you made a personal connection with outer space. </b><br />\r\nOne moment I will never forget is from when I was an astronaut. I remember floating over to the window for the first time, looking toward the horizon and seeing a very, very thin royal-blue line all the way across the horizon. It looked like someone had taken a blue pencil and outlined the <a href='PLANET:Earth' target='_blank'>Earth</a>. Then I realized that the blue line was Earth's atmosphere. It was memorable because it was obvious then how fragile and delicate our atmosphere is -- there just isn't very much of it-- but it sure is important!</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin clearfix'></div>\n<div class='quote'>\n\"Keep interested in science and do well in your math and science classes.

I also received a Master of Science and doctorate degrees in physics from Stanford in 1975 and 1978, respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I applied to NASA's astronaut program after reading an ad for it in a newspaper. Over 8,000 men and women applied to the space program that year. Of the 35 individuals accepted, six were women, and I was one of them. This was in January 1978. In August 1979, I completed a one-year training and evaluation period, which made me eligible for assignment as a mission specialist on future space shuttle flight crews. While in training, I worked on the development of the shuttle's robot arm. I also worked in mission control as a capsule communicator (CAPCOM) on the STS-2 and STS-3 missions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Who inspired you? </b><br />\r\nMy father was very, very inspirational. He was a middle-class, community college teacher in Southern California, and he put a real value on education. (My father had gone through school on the GI Bill, and he wanted to make sure that his daughters knew the importance of education to get ahead in the world.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I also played a lot of competitive tennis growing up -- I loved science, but if I was outside I was playing tennis and so professional tennis player Billie Jean King was one of my role models.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>What is a NASA Astronaut (former), President and CEO, Sally Ride Science?</b><br />\r\nI am the first American woman to fly in space. I was a mission specialist on STS-7, which launched from <a href='http://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/home/index.html' target='_blank'>Kennedy Space Center</a> (KSC), Fla. on 18 June 1983. I retired from NASA in 1987 after nine years of service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2001 I founded my own company, Sally Ride Science, to pursue my long-time passion of motivating girls and young women to pursue careers in science, math and technology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I wanted to start a company that would create good science programs and materials that would capture girls' imaginations, show both boys and girls a variety of role models (in everything from astrobiology to environmental engineering to rocket science) and encourage them to continue to pursue their interests as they grow older. I know that there are lots of girls out there who are just as interested in science as I was when I was growing up!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career? </b><br />\r\nRocketing into space aboard the space shuttle Challenger as the first American woman to fly in space is one of my favorite moments. The thing I liked best about being in space was being weightless! There's really nothing like it on Earth. When we first reached orbit, I did what lots of astronauts do: while I was still strapped in my seat, I held my pencil in front of my face and let go of it. It floated! Once I got used to weightlessness, I could do 30 somersaults in a row and slither like a seal from one side of the cabin to the other with just a gentle push.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And of course we couldn't resist playing a little bit with our food -- floating a blob of orange juice in the middle of the room, and sending peanuts drifting into each others' mouths from across the room.

Over the last five years she lived with inflammatory breast cancer, a rare and aggressive form of breast cancer that presents without a lump. She chronicled her life with cancer here on her blog Toddler Planet with honesty and emotion that were even more rare and aggressive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She is survived by her family, friends, achievements, and the indelible marks she made on people around the world. In lieu of flowers, please consider furthering Susan's legacy through a contribution to the Inflammatory Breast Cancer Research Foundation. Or please choose to make a difference somewhere, anywhere, to anyone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I can't begin to describe how her friends, those physically nearby and those she knew only on the internet, enabled her to carry on through five years of treatment and recurrence.

There's a fabulous quote on this, it's from Ruth Benedict ... 'I long to speak out the intense inspiration that comes to me from the lives of strong women. They have made of their lives a great adventure.' Susan, you are the strongest woman I know.\"\n</div>\n<footer>\n<cite>- Dr. James Green, Director of Planetary Science at NASA Headquarters</cite>\n</footer>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin'></div>\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><i>In her own words, Susan shared these thoughts on her career:</i></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Where are you from?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I was born on Fort Sam in Houston, Texas, and grew up in Jackson, Miss.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Describe the first time you made a personal connection with outer space.</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I remember writing away for lithographs from the <a href='http://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/home/index.html' target='_blank'>Johnson Space Center</a> (JSC) and being so excited when they arrived -- I was the only person I knew to have actual pictures of the planets and correspondence from NASA. (I think I kept even the envelope that they came in all the way through middle school.)</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin clearfix'></div>\n<div class='quote'>\n\"I remember seeing pictures of every astronaut that had ever flown in space and piped up, 'Why aren't there any woman astronauts?' It was on that day that I decided that my dream was to work for NASA, even if there weren't any girls there yet. Someday there would be, and I was going to be one of them.\"\n</div>\n<footer>\n<cite>- Susan Niebur</cite>\n</footer>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin'></div>\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>However, there is one particular moment in my childhood that stands out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I was a little girl, my parents took me to museums, parks and historical sites wherever we traveled. One time when I was three years old and while living in Galveston, Texas, we went on a tour of JSC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We went and saw everything, from the building where the old neutral buoyancy lab was, to the inside of mission control. I remember playing on the Saturn V rocket with kids from all around the country too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before we left we made one last stop: the one-room visitors' center where we admired the spacesuits. Leading up to the exit was a long blue wall with pictures of every astronaut that had ever flown in space. I stood there for a while, looking into their eyes, and was transfixed, as my mother says. Then I noticed something, and piped up, 'Why aren't there any woman astronauts?' It was on that day that I decided that my dream was to work for NASA, even if there weren't any girls there yet. Someday there would be, and I was going to be one of them.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>How did you end up working in the space program?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I worked very hard in school, because I knew that to be selected as an astronaut or to work at NASA as a scientist I would have to be very, very good, if not the best. NASA sent out information on the necessary preparation for astronauts, but not for scientists, so I followed the astronaut application as if it were a map for years and years, taking every science course I could get my hands on and winning awards in math and science. I led the statewide Mu Alpha Theta (math) organization in high school and discovered I loved public speaking and organizing, and I added those talents to my list as I went to college.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then, Physics 101 hit. As it turned out, I wasn't quite as good as I thought I was -- but I worked very hard and mastered not just 101, but graduate courses as an undergraduate, finishing my degree early, with research in experimental chaos under my belt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was on my way to a career in chaos when I met my husband, an aerospace engineering student who also had \"the NASA dream.\" Together we realigned our interests to our original goals, getting Ph.D.s in physics (me) and planetary science (him), so that we could fulfill our dreams of working for NASA or on NASA missions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I graduated, I came straight to Washington, D.C. for a career at NASA headquarters. It happened at that time headquarters was in a hiring freeze, but I was able to sneak in as a Presidential Management intern (PMI, now the Presidential Management Fellows program). I became a NASA civil servant in 2003 and the Discovery Program scientist soon thereafter.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='center image_module' style=''>\n<figure class='inline_figure'>\n<img alt='FILE:WomeninPlanetaryBreakfast.jpg' src='/images/content/WomeninPlanetaryBreakfast_720.jpg'>\n<figcaption>\nSusan's Women's Networking Breakfast is now an annual event, attended by 150-plus women, including management from NASA headquarters.\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I didn't know anyone who worked for NASA, but my father introduced me to scientists at his workplace (the University of Mississippi Medical Center), both male and female, and I respected them. I didn't really take any of them on as role models, because none of them seemed to be living my dream: a career in science, with a spouse equally enthusiastic about his career in science and enough time for the children I knew we'd have some day. (I was friends with many of those scientists' children, and I heard the kids talk about how they didn't get to see their dads enough. It made me sad, and I didn't know how to fix it. I guess I just assumed that when it was my turn, things would have changed, and it would be easy for me to have it all.)</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What are your main roles at NASA?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I am a former <a href='http://discovery.nasa.gov/index.cfml' target='_blank'>Discovery Program</a> scientist at NASA headquarters. I also run Niebur Consulting, a practice with two active NASA grants. The fast-paced, flexible practice gives me time to think deeply about space science policy and conduct independent research on the history of space science missions, the success of women in planetary science, and the factors that contribute to successful development and launch of space science missions. This research is supported by the NASA History of Scientific Exploration of Earth and Space program, and is complemented by outreach efforts, which include a series of interviews and community-building at <a href='http://womeninplanetaryscience.wordpress.com' target='_blank'>Women in Planetary Science</a>, a site created to build community and facilitate discussion about removing barriers to success. In addition, I also review proposals for NASA and other organizations, consult for for major aerospace companies and research institutions on proposal strategy and planning, and put together science teams for future mission proposals. I am immersed in social media both personally and professionally.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='image_module right' style='width: Color image of lego figures and a medicine bottle.px;'>\n<figure class='inline_figure'>\n<img alt='FILE:legowarriors.jpg' src='/images/content/legowarriors_250.jpg'>\n<figcaption>\n\"[My oldest son] asked me about the LEGO figure I keep at my computer, the Princess-Who-Can-Defend-Herself, complete with eyeglasses and sword, and he smiled with recognition as he responded, 'I know! She's you! She's inside you, fighting the cancer!'\"\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career.</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, I \"retired\" from NASA in 2006 after I had our first child and my telecommuting option was taken away. I was sad about that for quite a while, but I built my own business consulting with organizations and industry partners about future mission concepts and teams. I've been able to do my own research, most of it NASA-funded, on the history of the Discovery Program that I was part of at NASA headquarters, and I publish papers twice a year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lately, I've been invited to speak at panels such as the Women and Mars conference in Washington, D.C. (November, 2011), where I get to speak out about the planetary science profession as a whole, and what I've learned in my research. I really enjoy public speaking and sharing data with others who can then put it to use for their own needs. My favorite moment, hands-down, would have to be the first time I stepped up and did that on my own. In 2008, without a job or anyone besides my husband to back me up, I held a Women's Networking Breakfast at the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference. I reserved a small room out by the pool that you could only access through the garage -- it was miserable! -- but it was the only room available to someone without official credentials or mission work, like me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I wanted to gather the women together to address issues that I'd heard discussed year after year in the hallways and in the bathrooms -- frustrations with the difficulties inherent in the field, such as getting funding, changing jobs, serving on missions, and balancing work and family; difficulties that are only made worse by the fact that most of the women in this field are also married to men working in the field or in closely related disciplines. It was a gamble, but it paid off -- we had over 100 women attend, and they were eager to share their concerns and work towards resolving them in ways that helped the community as a whole.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now the breakfast is an annual event, attended by 150-plus women, including management from NASA headquarters. It is thrilling to see a room full of energetic, passionate women mentoring each other in real-time and making plans to do more throughout the year -- and to have NASA headquarters there too, listening.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There are so many career paths in planetary science, I've decided, after interviewing almost 50 women for a project on our web site, <a href='http://womeninplanetaryscience.wordpress.com' target='_blank'>Women in Planetary Science</a>, that there really is room for anyone to make their own. The important part is knowing what you want out of life, and then finding a way to make that happen. Want a career at NASA headquarters? Then get top grades and nourish a passion for making things right behind the scenes. Want to be an entrepreneur? Then meet lots of people, energize yourself with new ideas daily and then dedicate yourself to following up and finding your own funding. There are as many options as there are people -- but very few people follow exactly the same path any more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My career dreams, of staying at headquarters and moving to upper management as time went on, were dashed by my diagnosis with inflammatory breast cancer in 2007, a cancer that became metastatic, residing in my spine, neck, hips, ribs, and leg in 2010. Now, I am in chemotherapy for the rest of my life, which is essential for me to live. I can't work an 8-5 job anymore. But that doesn't mean that I have to give up. Instead, I forged my own path, bidding on work in industry and holding NASA research grants. I have created a career that allows the necessary time for treatment, recovery, physical therapy, and real time with my children. Will I be a mission PI? No. But I'm still able to contribute to the field despite my physical limitations. I think that's the advice. Know what is important to you, and find a way to make that happen.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My happiest moments are spent with my husband and children, playing games, telling stories, reading books, and just talking with each other. I also like to write, and to participate in social media events held by friends.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Study hard and find your passion. Ask around and find a research lab where you can contribute to the work being done. There's nothing like getting your hands dirty with instruments or data to help you understand where your real passion lies.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><br />\r\n<b>Read More:</b><br />\r\n*<a href='http://dps.aas.org/news/susan-niebur-1978-2012' target='_blank'>Division of Planetary Sciences Tribute to Susan</a><br />\r\n*<a href='http://livestre.am/1kDDw' target='_blank'>Susan Niebur Recognition</a><br />\r\n*<a href='http://livestre.am/1kDDv' target='_blank'>Susan Niebur Presentation</a><br />\r\n*<a href='http://susanniebur.com/' target='_blank'>Susan's Website</a><br />\r\n*<a href='http://toddlerplanet.wordpress.com/' target='_blank'>Susan's Blog</a><br />\r\n*<a href='http://nieburconsulting.com/' target='_blank'>Susan's Company Website</a><br />\r\n*<a href='https://twitter.com/#!/womenplanetsci' target='_blank'>Follow Susan on Twitter</a><br />\r\n*<a href='http://womeninplanetaryscience.wordpress.com/' target='_blank'>Women in Planetary Science Website</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n",

Each of us not only grieves at the passing of a tremendous individual but also for the loss his family suffers. Toby was the primary inspiration for the MWR experiment on Juno and his work during the proposal and development phases truly enabled the mission to be designed and eventually selected. Toby's pioneering work on the origin and composition of planetary atmospheres and comets was revolutionary and included telescopic, in-situ and laboratory driven models critical to our understanding of elemental abundances and isotopic ratios. Toby played a critical role in many of NASA and ESA's space missions including Viking, Voyager, Galileo, Rosetta, Cassini-Huygens, and of course, Juno.  Equally important, Toby also had a rare gift, the ability to explain the space program and how nature works to both the scientist and the public.  He will always be with us in spirit.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>&ndash; Dr. Scott Bolton, Principal Investigator, Juno mission to Jupiter</b></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>&ldquo;We lost a great scientist this week. Toby Owen&rsquo;s contributions to planetary science will long be remembered, and his love of science will live on through the work of our future missions, as it answers many of his most pressing questions.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>&ndash; Dr. James Green, Director, NASA Planetary Science Division</b></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>&ldquo;I am so sad to hear that Toby left us. I met Toby in 1984, one of the <i>fathers</i> of Cassini that became Cassini-Huygens in 1989. He worked tirelessly to help make Cassini-Huygens the great international mission it is today. I have learned so much about the planets and their moons from Toby. A great scientist, a great man, a great explorer. I will deeply miss him. My deepest sympathy to his family and all his friends.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>&ndash; Dr. Jean-Pierre Lebreton, Project Scientist for ESA's Huygens probe</b></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>The science community lost a giant with the passing of Toby Owen &hellip;and I lost a person who literally changed my life. I was one of Toby Owen&rsquo;s research assistants at Stony Brook University. One spring he let me know about NASA&rsquo;s Planetary Geology Internship Program. With his recommendation, I became an intern at JPL for the Voyager 1 & 2 Saturn encounters. I can directly trace Toby&rsquo;s endorsement to my career at JPL, my wife and my children.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGod speed Toby,</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>&ndash; Dr. Randii Wessen, A-Team Study Lead Architect, JPL Innovation Foundry</b><br />\r\n </p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>\"My strongest memory of Toby was the Galileo &ldquo;press conference from hell.\" The Galileo team members were struggling to explain to the press the results from the probe, each telling their story - but with jargon-laden terms that were just not getting across. Eventually, from the audience, Toby stood up and in a few sentences explained the essence of the scientific implications. He not only knew the details of the fundamental planetary science but he also could explain them. He will be sorely missed.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>&ndash; Dr. Fran Bagenal, Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics, University of Colorado</b></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>\"Tom Brokaw wrote a book called &ldquo;The Greatest Generation&rdquo;, referring to people raised during the Great Depression who then fought in World War II. There was certainly another &ldquo;Greatest Generation:\" that of planetary scientists, those who received their Ph.D.&rsquo;s between 1960 and roughly 1970, who forged the modern field of planetary science that we know today. Toby is one of the leading lights of that group. Indeed, Toby&rsquo;s dominant role in forming the DPS is documented here: <a href='https://dps.aas.org/history/chamberlain_cruikshank_1999' target='_blank'>https://dps.aas.org/history/chamberlain_cruikshank_1999</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is one of his many pioneering efforts from which we all benefit today. Another is his successful efforts to make Cassini-Huygens a reality and then to ensure that the probe would do great surface as well as atmospheric science. And yet another was in making Juno happen. I join all of us in saying I will truly, truly miss him.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>&ndash; Dr. Jonathan Lunine, Director Cornell Center for Astrophysics and Planetary Science</b></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>\"This is heartbreaking news.  Toby was one of the most perceptive, thoughtful, and most gracious persons I have ever known.  He was incredibly sharp but in a mysteriously soft-spoken way.  He could be challenging but never in a way that would make you feel diminished in his presence.  Just to talk with him for even a few minutes was to be invited into a realm of awareness where suddenly the world seemed brighter and larger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"I first met Toby in the mid-1980's during my work with the NASA-ESA Cassini Study Team.  He was at Stony Brook in those days ... and once invited me to give a talk out there.  I remember being wound way too tight for that occasion ... but Toby so kindly took me home to have dinner afterwards with his wife that evening ... first stopping at the grocery to thoughtfully select the makings of the meal ... then later pouring me a drink in his kitchen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"After moving to Hawaii, Toby would often have lunch with me on his trips through New York, sometimes at Grand Central Station or in the GISS/Columbia University neighborhood.  Although he and I worked in different areas, I nonetheless felt somehow mentored by his encouragement toward the engagement of important questions and the commitment to fighting for important flight experiments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"Well there is a wonderful (c.1970) photo of young Toby standing with Gerard Kuiper in front of the Texas radio telescope near Marfa, embedded within an article on the history of the DPS posted at <a href='https://dps.aas.org/history/chamberlain_cruikshank_1999' target='_blank'>https://dps.aas.org/history/chamberlain_cruikshank_1999</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"I am sure that Toby's gentle encouragement of so many people and so much powerfully constructive science will ripple far into the future.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>&ndash; Dr. Michael Allison, Emeritus Scientist, NASA/Goddard Institute for Space Studies</b></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>\"Tobias Owen &ndash; &laquo; Toby &raquo; for his friends and colleagues &ndash; passed away on March 4, in Sacramento, at the age of 80. He was an exceptional scientist, a pioneer in planetary exploration, and also a man of outstanding charisma.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"Toby&rsquo;s relationship with Paris Observatory goes back to the early beginning of the 1970s. While he was a professor at Sony Brook University (NY), he played a very active role in the development of the young planetology group at the Observatory. With Daniel Gautier, Catherine de Bergh, Michel Combes and Th&eacute;r&egrave;se Encrenaz, he initiated many research projects around the composition and structure of planetary atmospheres, using space exploration and ground-based observations. He played a major role in the analysis of space data from the Viking mission to Mars and the Voyager missions to the giant planets. With Jean-Pierre Maillard and the French planetology group, he made a series of major discoveries, in particular about the deuterium abundance in the solar system. In a visionary and multidisciplinary approach, he developed numerous research projects on all families of solar system objects, planets, satellites and comets, using all wavelength spectral ranges, from ground and space.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"In the early 1980s, with Daniel Gautier and Wing Ip, Toby became deeply involved in the development of an international space mission, jointly led by the United States and Europe, devoted to the exploration of Saturn and Titan. This project finally became the Cassini-Huygens mission, launched in 1997 and still in operation around Saturn. Beyond its exceptional scientific return, this mission has been an exemplary success in terms of international cooperation between different space agencies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"In addition to his interest in planetology, Toby early developed interest for the origin of life and the search for extraterrestrial life, a research area that has exploded over the past decades. With Donald Goldsmith and David Morrisson respectively, he published two books on this subject, both now in their third edition. He received many honors and awards, including, in 2009, the prestigious Kuiper Prize of the Division of Planetary Sciences of the American Astronomical Society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"With his French friends and colleagues, at Paris Observatory and beyond, Toby has developed very strong links of scientific cooperation and friendship. In the early 2000s, he joined the High Scientific Council of Paris Observatory. In 2006, with Daniel Gautier and Jean-Pierre Lebreton, he received the Grand Prix Marcel Dassault of the French Academy of Sciences. In 2007, he became Doctor Honoris Causa of Paris Observatory. Toby was strongly in favor of bringing together scientific communities beyond national frontiers. He made numerous visits in France where he had very close friends, in particular Antonella Barucci and Marcello Fulchignoni. He will be deeply missed by all his friends and colleagues, who will remember his generosity, his availability, his kindness, his simplicity and modesty. All his friends and colleagues, at LESIA and at Paris Observatory, want to express their deepest sympathy to his wife Natasha and his family.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>&ndash; Th. Encrenaz, C. de Bergh, A.

When I knew him on Galileo, in the days of Clayne Yeates, he seemed larger than life. I met him again when I joined Juno. Scott Bolton had asked me to write the History of Juno. Toby, Scott and I often hung out together after science team meetings. He brought a cultural dimension to Juno that I appreciated. We bonded.<br />\r\nHe recognized the value of bringing art and literature and music and history and visualization into the realm of Juno. He and Scott even toyed with the idea of a Juno Opera. He was a huge supporter of the Juno Earth encounter, from a philosophical as well as an outreach perspective. He saw the value and supported the building of the models of the Juno trajectory at Earth and at Jupiter. He was an enthusiastic early reviewer, perceptive critic, and ardent supporter of the Juno History as it has evolved. His friendship and support these last 11 years on Juno have been memorable and have enriched my life beyond description. I will surely miss him.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>&ndash; Theo Clarke, Consultant, Juno Mission to Jupiter</b></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><b>Read More:</b><br />\r\n*Division of Planetary Sciences of the American Astronomical Society Obituary: <a href='https://dps.aas.org/news/tobias-c.-owen-1936-2017' target='_blank'>https://dps.aas.org/news/tobias-c.-owen-1936-2017</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>*Juno Mission Team Page: <a href='https://www.missionjuno.swri.edu/the-team/ ' target='_blank'>https://www.missionjuno.swri.edu/the-team/ </a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>*The Beginnings of the Division for Planetary Sciences of the American Astronomical Society: <a href='https://dps.aas.org/history/chamberlain_cruikshank_1999' target='_blank'>https://dps.aas.org/history/chamberlain_cruikshank_1999</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>*Dr. Owen's University of Hawaii Institute for Astronomy Page: <a href='https://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/users/owen/default/owen.shtml' target='_blank'>https://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/users/owen/default/owen.shtml</a></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><i><b>Editor's Note:</b> Dr. Tobias \"Toby\" Owen passed away on March 4, 2017.

The original Palace Hotel was built in 1875 and was destroyed in the great San Francisco earthquake and fire of 1906. The New Palace opened in 1909, occupying the same space as the original. One of the key features of the hotel, old and new, was and is the Grand Court. It originally served as the elegant entrance area for horse-drawn carriages. Since it was rebuilt the Grand Court, also known as the Palm Court, has served as one of San Francisco&rsquo;s most prestigious dining rooms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tobias &ldquo;Toby&rdquo; Owen was born in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, one of three brothers. He was raised in Denver, CO and Santa Fe, NM. His parents were intellectuals. They cultivated in the young Owen an interest in literature, music, and the fine arts. He learned to recognize the constellations in the clear, dark skies of Santa Fe, following the planets as they moved through the zodiac. Some thirty years later when he was observing Saturn from the McDonald observatory he noticed that the planet was in the constellation Gemini, where he had seen it while in Santa Fe. In one Saturnian year, he had grown from a boy staring at the night sky to an astronomer recording the spectra of planets and their satellites. After his 5th grade the Owen family moved to Milwaukee, WI. As a youth Owen&rsquo;s passions included sailing, tennis, swimming and fly-fishing. He competed successfully in tennis and swimming at the high school level. He played football in the 7th grade, but unfortunately broke his back during a game. He was stuck in a cast and brace for a year. While practically immobilized he built a 6-inch telescope, grinding the mirror in his basement. He observed Jupiter and the other planets, seeing those moving points of light in the night sky revealed as worlds that could be explored.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He was awarded an academic scholarship to the University of Chicago and entered the University at the age of 15. He likes to say that next to a fine education, the most valuable experience he had at the University was learning to play respectable tennis from the excellent coach in the fine field house. What a surprise that was! Another surprise was the presence of a 6-inch refracting telescope on the roof of the physics building. With a high-quality lens and a clock drive, this instrument provided welcome opportunities for a young student eager to carry on the programs begun with his home-made telescope in Milwaukee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Owen took a year off after his BA to study as an exchange student at the Goethe Universitaet in Frankfurt, Germany. While becoming fluent in German, he traveled through Greece and the west coast of Turkey, fulfilling fantasies kindled by reading Homer and the Greek myths while growing up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Owen earned his BS and MS in Physics at the U of Chicago, and went on to earn his PhD in Astronomy in 1965 at the U of Arizona. He was a student of the late Gerard P. Kuiper, an illustrious Dutch-American astronomer who was probably the leading planetary scientist in the world at that time. Kuiper started the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory (LPL) at the U of Arizona in 1960; Owen was one of the first students. He found Kuiper to be an inspiring scientist and a stimulating thesis advisor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1968 Owen and Carl Sagan, along with a parallel effort by Joseph Chamberlain, founded the Division of Planetary Science (DPS) as a subdivision of the American Astronomical Society (AAS). In 1984 the DPS established the Gerard P. Kuiper prize, to be awarded annually to recognize and honor those scientists whose achievements have most advanced our understanding of planetary science. Owen was awarded the Kuiper prize in 2009.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After earning his PhD, Owen served as Professor of Astronomy for 20 years at the State University of New York (SUNY), Stony Brook, making observations of Jupiter and the other planets with the large telescopes in Texas, Arizona, and California. He joined the NASA Viking mission to Mars in 1971. His goal was to discover and study the noble gases in the Martian atmosphere to tease out some of the secrets about the origins of atmospheres of both Mars and Earth. Viking&rsquo;s mass spectrometer (under the leadership of Klaus Biemann) showed that Argon, Krypton and xenon in the atmosphere of Mars have the same relative abundances as they do on Earth; distinctly different from the gases found in ordinary meteorites.. Owen suggested that this unique similarity implied a common carrier as a source of noble gases and hence some fraction of other volatiles like nitrogen and carbon dioxide in both Mars and Earth. If so, it would offer strong evidence that Mars was once a habitable planet like Earth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Owen and Akiva Bar-Nun proposed that the common carriers of volatiles to both planets could have been comets. Bar-nun&rsquo;s laboratory experiments had shown that ice forming at low temperatures can trap the noble gases in the observed abundances. The comet delivery hypothesis will be rigorously tested when the Rosetta spacecraft reaches its target, Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, in 2015. Owen is a member of the mass spectrometer team.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Owen joined the Voyager Mission to the outer solar system as a member of the Imaging Team led by Brad Smith. He remained a team member for all 4 Voyager outer planet encounters. Owen proposed and led a successful search for a Jovian Ring with the Voyager cameras. As chair of the IAU outer solar system nomenclature committee, Owen established rules for naming features on satellites and names for newly discovered moons. He proposed many of these names himself. Overall, more than 2000 new names were applied by the full complement of IAU Nomenclature Committees. <br />\r\nOwen left Stony Brook in 1989 for a position as Astronomer and Professor at the Institute for Astronomy of the University of Arizona. He joined the Galileo Mission to Jupiter as an interdisciplinary scientist and a member of Hasso Nieman&rsquo;s mass spectrometer team on the atmospheric probe. All of the heavy elements the probe could measure were found to be enriched by about a factor of three compared with solar abundances. Owen stressed that this discovery meant that the classical paradigm for the formation of the outer planets had to be shifted. However, it proved to be impossible to measure the abundance of oxygen. Because this is the third most abundant element in the universe, its abundance must be known to understand Jupiter&rsquo;s origin and present interior structure. Furthermore, oxygen is the essential ingredient of water, the sine qua non for all the living matter we know. Hence the history of water in our solar system is intimately connected with the origin and evolution of life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Jupiter, oxygen must be present in the form of H2O, just as we find CH4 and NH3, not C and N. Thus to measure the global abundance of oxygen, we must reach below the level where H2O condenses. Unfortunately the Galileo probe measurements were stopped well above this level owing to the extreme heat and pressure. A measurement of the oxygen abundance is one of the key objectives of the Juno mission. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the 1980&rsquo;s began there was intense competition for the next NASA &ldquo;flagship&rdquo; mission. Owen was chair of a NASA Outer Solar System working group that proposed a Saturn Orbiter with a Titan probe. Simultaneously, Owen&rsquo;s friend and colleague Daniel Gautier with Wing Ip had assembled a group of scientists in Europe who approached ESA with the same idea. It rapidly became clear that neither side could afford such a mission; collaboration seemed a logical solution. The Americans would take responsibility for the orbiter, to be named Cassini (as suggested by Ip) and the Europeans would make the probe, named Huygens. Two international working groups were established to develop a proposal for the Huygens component. Owen was chair of the US group, Gautier and Ip led the European team. Together they hammered out the Cassini/Huygens proposal which was ultimately approved by ESA and NASA in 1989. Owen fought hard for this mission, making winning presentations to the ESA solar system division and the NASA administrator, and lobbying the US Congress for funding. Cassini/ Huygens has been outrageously successful, soft-landing the Huygens probe for a series of experiments on the surface of Titan in 2005 while the Cassini orbiter is still obtaining data while circling Saturn as this is being written. Owen is an interdisciplinary scientist and a member of Hasso Niemann&rsquo;s mass spectrometer team.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>{Both Giovanni Domenico Cassini and Christian Huygens were keen observers of the Saturn system. Here is Huygens, putting discovery of Titan (&lsquo;the brightest&rsquo;) in context: &ldquo;The Jovial (sic) [satellites] we owe to Galileo, &lsquo;tis well known: and anyone may imagine he was in no small rapture at the discovery. The outermost but one, and brightest of Saturn&rsquo;s, it chanc&rsquo;d to be my lot to have first sight of it in the year 1655. The rest (4 at the time) we may thank the industrious Cassini for&hellip;&rdquo;}</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Owen related how he met Scott Bolton. Owen was having lunch in the JPL cafeteria just after a Galileo mission meeting, and Bolton came over and asked him what one could do with a spacecraft going under the radiation belts at Jupiter. Owen answered with one word, &ldquo;Water!&rdquo; Bolton subsequently added several other important objectives that could be satisfied by a polar orbiter inside the radiation belts. This became a proposal that Bolton and Owen organized with the help of the instrument team leaders for a new mission to Jupiter, appropriately named &ldquo;Juno.&rdquo; Just as Juno the goddess, with her special powers, penetrated the clouds Jupiter had cast over the Peloponnese to conceal his dalliance with the nymph Io, so Juno the spacecraft, with its special powers, will penetrate the clouds of Jupiter to reveal the secrets the planet conceals.<br />\r\nBolton named Owen Chair of the Juno Origins Working Group. Among the expected results from the mission, Owen is particularly interested in the abundance of water in Jupiter&rsquo;s atmosphere and its bearing on the enrichment of heavy elements, the planet&rsquo;s origin and its effects on the distribution of matter in the solar system. Constraints on the mass and size of a core, if one exists are also of critical importance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2011 Owen retired from the U of Hawaii and moved to Sacramento, CA with his wife Natasha. He maintains an Emeritus and Research Affiliate position with the University of Arizona Institute for Astronomy and remains an interdisciplinary scientist on Cassini and a participant in the Curiosity and Rosetta Missions as well as CoI and Acting Chair of the Origins Working Group on Juno.<br />\r\n </p>\r\n",

Six months later, in a small ceremony in Mrs. Phair's home, Stern and SDC Principal Investigator Mihaly Horanyi presented her with a plaque, certificate and spacecraft model to commemorate the renaming. \"She was a thoroughly intelligent, likable and endearing woman,\" Stern says. \"The entire New Horizons team is saddened by her passing.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The New Horizons dust counter is the first the first science instrument on a NASA planetary mission to be designed, built and operated by students, and by late next year it will be operating farther out in the solar system than any dust measurement instrument in history. Stern and the SDC team members thought it fitting to name instrument built by students after Mrs. Phair, who was just an 11-year-old student herself when she made her historic suggestion of a name for Pluto in 1930.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"Her death deeply saddens the former and current crew of the VBSDC instrument,\" says Horanyi, who, like the dust counter student team, is from the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics at the University of Colorado, Boulder. \"Her contribution will be lasting, not only by naming Pluto, but also by giving an example to young people of the value of intellectual curiosity and the rewards of a lifelong interest in science and discovery.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>This interview was recorded shortly before the January 2006 launch of NASA's New Horizons mission to explore Pluto and the Kuiper Belt.

I'm talking to Venetia Phair, the lady who 76 years ago had the distinction of suggesting the name for Pluto, the newly discovered ninth planet. Venetia is currently a retired school teacher in Epsom, England.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='image_module right' style='width: Venetia Phairpx;'>\n<figure class='inline_figure'>\n<img src='/images/content/venetia-phair.jpg'>\n<figcaption>\nVenetia at 89 (Photo courtesy of Martin George 2009).\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p><b>At NASA we're very excited because next Tuesday, hopefully, we're going to launch the first robotic mission to Pluto. And given that you had the historic role of naming the planet, I wonder if you are quite excited about that?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes I certainly am.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Venetia, can you tell us a little bit about the circumstances that happened in 1930 that brought you to suggest the name of Pluto?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, I don't quite know why I suggested it. I think it was on March the 14th, 1930 and I was having breakfast with my mother and my grandfather. And my grandfather read out at breakfast the great news and said he wondered what it would be called. And for some reason, I after a short pause, said, \"Why not call it Pluto?\" I did know, I was fairly familiar with Greek and Roman legends from various children's books that I had read, and of course I did know about the solar system and the names the other planets have. And so I suppose I just thought that this was a name that hadn't been used. And there it was. The rest was entirely my grandfather's work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>And your grandfather (Falconer Madan) was a librarian I understand who had a lot of friends who were astronomers.</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>That's exactly right. He was retired He had been Bodleian's Librarian, which is the head librarian in the Bodleian at Oxford, which is the university library of course.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>And he suggested the name to the astronomer Herbert Hall Turner, who then in turn cabled the idea to the American astronomers at the Lowell Observatory. Is that correct?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>That is correct, yes. Professor Turner had been Astronomer Royal in the past and was a professor at Oxford. On the day it was suggested-my grandfather dropped a note to him-he was, on that day, attending a meeting in London of the Royal Astronomical Society. They were all thinking about names, but for some reason, none of them thought of Pluto.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>And you thought about it because of the Greek and Roman mythology about Pluto being the god of the underworld?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I don't think...I doubt if I was as subtle as that. I just thought it was a name that hadn't been used so far, and might be an obvious one to have.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>And was it also because the first two letters PL have a connection with Percival Lowell?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>No, I certainly didn't realize that or appreciate that at the time. But I quite see it would be a major factor in their deciding it would be a good name. And it is certainly appropriate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>What happened once the planet was named? I understand it was named in May of 1930. Were you thrilled when you heard that your suggestion was the one; that Pluto would be the name?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, I certainly was thrilled. It was very exciting for a small girl really at the time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>How were you informed about it?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think my grandfather told me. I'd heard nothing you see. I'd just really forgotten about it for the intervening months. But he was fairly active.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Was there any great fanfare when the name was announced?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well not...to a limited extent. I think the newspapers were mostly occupied by the exploits of the woman pilot Amy Johnson at the time (Amy Johnson was the pioneering English aviatrix who in May 1930 became the first woman to fly solo from Britain to Australia). Anyway, there was a certain amount...you know a few papers I think. My grandfather collected any information there was through a press agency and put it into two scrapbooks that I have, which I treasure, and from which I can refresh my memory at times.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Well we hope you have that scrapbook out next week when we launch New Horizons.</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, I expect so. What I know is, I've just been by the way sent rather a nice little badge by Johns Hopkins University, which I think is probably the badge I would have been wearing if I'd been able to go to the launch. So I think I'll wear it from now until after the launch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Wonderful. Now I understand your great uncle Henry Madan named the moons of Mars Phobos and Deimos. So you come from a family of people who name heavenly bodies?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, I think that is one of the nicest things about the whole story. I'm so very pleased because he had done that from a much more knowledgeable base that I came upon the name Pluto. It's all been very nice for me really.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>I would imagine so. Have you ever seen Pluto through a telescope?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I don't think I have. I've just seen a photograph of Pluto, I think the first photograph that Clyde Tombaugh was looking at, and the next picture showing that the same little pinpoint had moved a certain degree. I have been to Flagstaff, and they were very kind. And they showed us around and they showed us the telescope through which it was first seen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Did you ever meet Clyde Tombaugh?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>No, never, sadly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Did you ever correspond with him?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>No.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>I understand that some school kids here in America recently corresponded with you from the St. Mary's Episcopal School in Memphis. That must have been nice.</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, it was a great joy. I quite suddenly had 62 letters. I think they all sat down, all the eight and nine year olds, with instructions to write a letter to me. This must have been an English essay or something. But they were very charming letters. And I enjoyed each and every one of them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Do people in your home town know you have this role in history?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not to any great extent. Some of them may know because I believe that the BBC when it does it's coverage of the launch, which I'm sure will be fairly thorough, may slip in a bit, a small interview with me. But on the whole, it doesn't arise in conversation and you don't just go around telling people that you named Pluto. But quite a lot of friends know and are interested.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>You mean you've never had that temptation at a holiday gathering to tell your friends that?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well not really, but sometimes it's nice, sometimes I'm glad to have them know.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>What if anything would you like to tell all the scientists and engineers and all the people who worked on this New Horizons mission? What would you say to them?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I would say, I think, \"The best of luck.\" And I can only hope that they discover all that they want to discover from this probe which must be one of the most exciting things that has happened astronomically recently.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>When you look back at your life, isn't it exciting that there you were an 11 year old school girl who named this planet, and we've come so far technologically that now we can send a spacecraft all this distance in the solar system to this planet Pluto?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, it is absolutely amazing, but it is paralleled by almost everything that has happened in the world, hasn't it. I mean we have stepped so far into the future as it were since the 1920's and 1930's. It leaves one absolutely stunned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Do you like to look up at the stars?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Very much. Sadly it gets increasingly difficult to (do this). It's so well lit around here that only the brightest stars really get a look-in unless we have a power outage of course. But occasionally if one is in the country, and it is a good clear night, it is absolutely wonderful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Now I understand you were a teacher. What did you teach?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I taught economics, which had been my subject in university and a little elementary math.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>And at no time had you ever told your students that you had named Pluto?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I don't think so. No. It didn't really come to mind much. There had been years and years when I never really thought about it. I think its only since Patrick Moore wrote an article in Sky and Telescope in 1984, and I should think that since then there has been an increasing amount of interest in it, especially in America, which has been delightful for me because as one gets older one's horizons narrow. And it's been very nice have to have say these letters from St. Mary's in Memphis, or this chat right now shall we say.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>It's been very nice for you to talk with us too. And on behalf of NASA we really thank you for your enthusiasm and all you've done to help advance the exploration and discovery of the universe around us.</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well that's very nice of you. I have my kind invitation from NASA, and I treasure that too. I shall put it on the mantelpiece, I think, conspicuously, to look at. And I just wish everybody concerned with the launch that the whole thing will be the success that they hope.</p>\r\n",

      "body": "<h3><b>Where are you from?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I was born in Brooklyn, N.Y., but grew up on Long Island in a small village called Malverne. It is located about 45 minutes from Manhattan, which gave me ready access to both New York City and the Long Island suburbs when growing up.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Describe the first time you made a personal connection with outer space.</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I remember watching as many of the early NASA manned space launches on television as I could. In school they would sometimes bring a television into class so we could watch them. As a kid I used to write to NASA to get pictures of the astronauts.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=''>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin clearfix'></div>\n<div class='quote'>\n\"My parents helped give me confidence that I could learn, but also they gave me the discipline to understand that I had to work at it.\"\n</div>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin'></div>\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>The first real close connection I had to space was in ninth grade, when a friend and I wrote a report on something like \"The Physics of Space Flight\" for our Earth science class. A few of us also set up an after school astronomy club that met at a friend's house once a week. That Earth science class also had a big impact on my interests in the world around me. One could hypothesize that there is a real connection between that class and my NASA Earth science career!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>How did you end up working in the space program?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I did not follow a traditional path. My formal education was in chemistry, and I did my Ph.D. in theoretical physical chemistry at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), working on the quantum mechanics of chemical reactions with an aim toward being able to understand, and ultimately calculate, reactivity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I decided that I was more interested in using rate constants than calculating them, and from auditing classes in Earth and planetary science I became exposed to studies of planetary atmospheres. I ended up doing post-doctoral research in this area at the U.S. Naval Research Lab in Washington, D.C. From there, I was hired as a chemist in a group of meteorologists at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. That gave me a chance to study the chemistry of Earth's atmosphere, focusing on stratospheric ozone -- the protective layer of ozone in the upper atmosphere that absorbs most of the sun's ultraviolet light. After some six years at Goddard, I moved to NASA Headquarters, where I've been working ever since.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is an associate director for research?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In my job as associate director for research in the Earth Science Division of NASA's Science Mission Directorate, I am responsible for the research program that NASA has to study the Earth, using satellites, aircraft, surface-based measurements and computer models. The program covers everything from the center of the Earth to the stratopause -- the boundary between the stratosphere and mesosphere layers of the atmosphere -- including the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere, biosphere, land surface and Earth's interior!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career.</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It's hard to pick just one. I've had so many interesting opportunities and great experiences. Here are a couple of very different memorable examples.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As program scientist for the ATLAS (Atmospheric Laboratory for Applications and Science) series of space shuttle flights in the 1990s, I helped oversee the science carried out by the payload (as many as a dozen instruments) that came from several different countries. Being involved in those missions was great fun, and I learned so much about how valuable Earth observations were made in space and how the shuttle observations could both contribute to and benefit from satellite observations. I attended five shuttle launches -- three for the ATLAS missions, and two others -- which was always a humbling experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a program manager, one of the great joys for me was to help early-career investigators get their first awards to help establish them in their careers. Seeing them succeed was so rewarding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In my current role associate director for research, being able to periodically \"make something happen\" by green-lighting ideas that come to the Earth Science Division from our staff and the community, and then putting programs in place to address those objectives, is a wonderful feeling.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='image_module left' style='width: Jack Kaye visits the state zoo of North Carolina in Asheboro in Feb. 2016.px;'>\n<figure class='inline_figure'>\n<img src='/images/content/kaye_350x2401.jpg'>\n<figcaption>\nJack Kaye visits the state zoo of North Carolina in Asheboro in Feb. 2016.\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Many teachers I had all throughout my education inspired me. In particular, I remember my high school Earth science teacher, Robert Johnson, and my undergraduate physical chemistry professor, Stanley Windwer (at Adelphi University).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In graduate school, I was exposed to Earth science through professor Yuk Yung at Caltech, who was very open and approachable in encouraging me to pursue my interests in atmospheric science. I consider it a privilege to count him as a colleague now!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My parents helped give me confidence that I could learn, but also they gave me the discipline to understand that I had to work at it. My brother set a great example. He excelled in learning, but I never remember feeling I had to compete with him; just follow his example.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My advice is to try to find the right balance of depth and breadth -- and that balance may be different for everyone. While you have to become expert in something, it's also good to pay attention to related areas and keep learning. I changed fields and feel that I've never really stopped learning new things.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It's also good to understand the broader societal and scientific context in which you're doing your work, and to think about how you can tell others (not just scientists) about the work that you're doing.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I like to spend time with my family, of course, and to walk, read and cook.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Besides the typical science-related advice, I would encourage those looking to work in STEM -- science, technology, engineering and mathematics -- disciplines to get comfortable with public speaking. Most scientists have many opportunities to talk about their work, and it's so helpful to be able to do that without a lot of stress. The presentations that one does will almost certainly be better if one really enjoys it. Taking a public speaking class may be really helpful. I did that in my first semester of college, and I think that had a major impact in reducing anxiety about public speaking. It's also good to talk about one's work to different audiences as opportunities come along. Having some similar comfort in writing is also really valuable. Taking advantage of opportunities to write can be helpful. I did a bunch of student newspaper work in college, and having to write something almost every week for four years was great training.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><b>Read More</b><br />\r\n<a href='http://science.nasa.gov/earth-science/' target='_blank'>NASA Earth Science</a><br />\r\n<a href='https://www.nasa.gov/ozone' target='_blank'>NASA Ozone</a><br />\r\n<a href='http://aura.gsfc.nasa.gov/ozone.html' target='_blank'>NASA's Aura Satellite</a><br />\r\n<a href='http://science.nasa.gov/missions/atlas/' target='_blank'>NASA's ATLAS Mission</a><br />\r\n<a href='http://science.nasa.gov/missions/sage-3-iss/' target='_blank'>NASA's Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment III</a></p>\r\n",

      "body": "<h3><b>Where are you from? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If you look at a map of the 48 states and stick a pin right in the center, you will come pretty close to hitting my hometown; Burlington, Iowa. Burlington is located right on the Mississippi River, and I was a \"river rat\" as they say -- growing up water skiing and catching catfish.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Describe the first time you made a personal connection with outer space. </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Burlington High School had a 12-inch Alvan Clark refractor, built in the 1930s and donated many years later by the original owner, who was quite a successful businessman in the area. The telescope was 15 feet long and stood over 10 feet high and was very impressive to look at. The old physics teacher who managed the telescope retired and the keys to the observatory went to the young energetic chemistry teacher, Don Vinson.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the beginning of my senior year I took chemistry, and Mr. Vinson, who had just taken a summer astronomy course at the University of Iowa, announced in class that he was starting an after school astronomy class with open access to the 12 inch refractor. The whole concept of learning and using a quality telescope really intrigued me, and I signed up immediately. The class was a tremendous learning experience for me, and I began connecting a 35mm camera to various telescope eyepieces. From then on I did all kinds of astrophotography. I also learned how to develop black and white film. Some of my photos even ended up in the magazine \"Sky and Telescope.\" Mr. Vinson had really created an environment of rapid and exciting learning that I think still burns inside of me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><blockquote>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin clearfix'></div>\n<div class='quote'>\n\"From an academic point of view, it's all about doing well in math and science. However, there is absolutely no substitute for being determined. Being determined to be successful is at least half the game.\"\n</div>\n<footer>\n<cite>- Jim Green</cite>\n</footer>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin'></div>\n</blockquote></span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>How did you end up working in the space program? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It was a natural step for me to go from studying practical astronomy in high school, to majoring in astronomy at the University of Iowa. But the real switch to the space program came after I got my Bachelor of Arts in Astronomy and stayed at the University of Iowa for graduate school. I was pretty broke at that time in my life, and I applied for a teaching assistant (TA) position. After finding out that my astronomy advisor didn't support me working as a TA, I switched advisors to Dr. Don Gurnett, one of my favorite undergraduate teachers. Dr. Gurnett is a fantastic space scientist and one of the best instructors I have ever had. He took me on immediately as a research assistant (RA). In the mean time, to make ends meet I had already taken a position as a computer operator in the physics department, which had three \"fast\" and large Univac computers. At this point, my mindset changed from doing ground-based astronomy to doing space-based astronomy. This switch was so easy to make since it was still all about the science -- not about how and what tools one uses to do the science.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once again my environment for learning was perfect. As an RA, I wrote programs for Dr. Gurnett and set up a whole variety of other standard computer analysis programs that would read data from space missions such as IMP-6, IMP-8, and Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 to be executed on the Univac computers. Then, when my computer operator shift started, I would go to work running all the jobs that were set up to be executed on the 4 o'clock to midnight shift. On many occasions the midnight to 8 a.m. operator would call in sick, so I would work that shift too. By around 4 a.m. I would be done and I would then begin work on my own programs and run them on the computers. By 6 a.m. it was time to pull the microfilm output and develop it; having everyone's microfilm ready by the start of the 8 a.m. shift. When the 8 a.m. operator came in, I just went to class. In 1976, as a graduate student, I had published my first paper on the angular distribution of Auroral Kilometric Radiation. It utilized data from IMP-6, IMP-8, and was stored on 125 data tapes that would take nearly eight hours of computer time to run. No one could touch this type of analysis and the paper was well received and highly cited in technical papers for years.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Besides my high school teacher Mr. Vinson, there was one other. As a sophomore at the University of Iowa, I took \"Astronomy 101\" from Dr. James A. Van Allen. It was an easy \"A\" for me since I already understood most of the material from my high school astronomy class. I have to say that Dr. Van Allen was such a truly tremendous teacher that he made the class very enjoyable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The following semester I had an opportunity to take a two-credit hour elective class, so I chose \"Readings in Astronomy.\" This class was taught by \"staff\" and was to be held on the 7th floor of Van Allen Hall. I arrived on time for the class to start and walked into the assigned corner room on the 7th floor. As I stood in the entry way of the large room I was amazed to see that it was just full of computer printouts, data tapes, books, and other clutter -- hardly a classroom. As I searched the class list looking for what must be the real room number, a face appeared from behind a book case with a voice that said, \"come on in Jim, this is my office.\" It was Dr. James Van Allen, and I was his only student! I never really thought that I had distinguished myself, since Dr. Van Allen probably gave out at least 20 more A's in such a huge class. Over the next couple of classes I told him about my access to the Alvan Clark telescope and the astrophotography that I had done. I even brought in my collection of solar photos to show him, that I had taken every day, spanning over two summers. The moment Dr. Van Allen saw those images he said that we needed to do some research on this data. The \"Readings in Astronomy\" course allowed me to use my extensive solar data to measure differential rotation of the Sun and write my first science-like paper for Dr. Van Allen. It was that whole process that Dr. Van Allen himself guided me through that really hooked me on space research.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is a Director of Planetary Science? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I feel a strong sense of responsibility to the entire planetary science community. I view my job as the keeper of NASA's planetary program and the top advocate for that program to flourish and grow. That growth depends on me working with the science community to understand their issues and make the right decisions. Part of my job also includes advocacy of the next major planetary mission to NASA leadership and the Administration, based on the recommendations of the Planetary Science Decadal report coming out next year. That responsibility weighs heavily on me, but I am delighted to say I am not alone in this effort. I have a wonderful, highly motivated and talented staff making these activities successful. NASA's Planetary Science division has grown every year during my tenure and continues to be vital to the nation in many ways. I look forward to the planetary science community's continued growth, and of course being part of the spectacular discoveries they make every day.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Wow, that is really hard to do since I have had so many. I have given a number of science talks. I had the opportunity to teach at the International Space University (ISU) and at times the students gave me a standing ovation at the end of my lecture -- that was a fantastic feeling. Also fantastic is when I look out into an audience and realize that I have their complete attention and can hear a pin drop.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While working as a scientist at NASA's <a href='http://www.nasa.gov/centers/marshall/home/index.html' target='_blank'>Marshall Space Flight Center</a> (MSFC) I had the opportunity to be a safety diver in the Neutral Buoyancy tank for which my training enabled me to overcome a potentially dangerous situation. That too was a fantastic feeling. But I will have to say, even after watching the spectacular launch of the <a href='http://image.gsfc.nasa.gov/' target='_blank'>Imager for Magnetopause-to-Aurora Global Exploration</a> (IMAGE) mission that I worked so hard on for years, it was getting the first set of IMAGE data coming in for analysis and recognizing something that had never been discovered before in these scientific measurements. The greatest <i>rush</i> for me in this business is the first discoveries and the \"ah ha\" moments. I have had the privilege to have several \"ah ha\" moments in my career.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you? </b><br />\r\nFrom an academic point of view, it's all about doing well in math and science.

I remember I was about five-years old, and I had a fascination with outer space and dinosaurs. This fascination came from the older generation always telling me - and my siblings - stories about our ancestors which often involved Mother Earth and Father Sky. These stories increased my curiosity in how the Universe was created and what makes up the great Universe we all live in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These days, I always find myself watching documentaries on space science.

When I chose my major, I looked to incorporate my passion for model-building.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2010, while interning at NTU, I was given the opportunity to reverse engineer a satellite by <a href='http://www.nasa.gov/' target='_blank'>NASA</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What it means to reverse engineer something is to measure an object without any CAD (computer-aided design) files for it - you have to recreate it without exact measurements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I chose to create a model over a laser scanning project. I was given a 3D PDF file of NASA's Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE) satellite to create a small scale model for NASA to use at events.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I became very interested in this project. Other interns and I had to measure all the components of the satellite in the 3D PDF software. Some of the parts were unrecognizable, so we had to improvise in order to complete these. This was a 10-week project, but with the amount of detail I wanted to add, it took me an additional year and a half to complete (of which I used much of my own personal time) in order to provide the best model I could design.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We at the university were pretty happy with the end product. Our LADEE model went over and beyond the initial want of our client; and as a result of this success, NASA is sending the university more files in order to create more models. My goal is to become a designer for NASA because I enjoy working with them.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I never really had a role model in my life, but in 2008 I was blessed with my one and only daughter -- she has given me all the inspiration I have ever needed. Though it's considered clich&eacute;, I want my daughter to have \"the life I never had as a child.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is a Student Intern? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My career has not officially started yet because I am still attending school at NTU. Since I am still in college, I am only a student intern. However, if I could choose a job title it would be mechanical designer. I would love to work in component design and simulation, as well as laser scanning.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career. </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I did enjoy being invited to <a href='http://www.nasa.gov/centers/wallops/home/#.UzIGNvldV8E' target='_blank'>NASA's Wallops Flight Facility</a> on Chincoteague Island in Virginia where I was pleased to see LADEE launch. I had never expected to travel to the East Coast, especially to a NASA center, but with hard work, dedication and ambition I was given the opportunity. This experience has motivated me to push even harder to do what inspires me. I am enjoying the outcome; I have met many scholars and have had the honor to work with NASA.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Embrace the career path you have chosen, and don't let anyone discourage you. I've had my share of people criticizing me; thinking that I am being over ambitious and trying to accomplish and push myself too far for my job. My response always is \"I'm not doing this to impress anyone; I do the work because I want to see the results of my capabilities.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I haven't started my career yet, so I can't say what the actual job entails. I like to read about projects that interest me and apply their experience to my education so I can be as ready as I can be. As difficult as the path may seem, there are goals you are shooting for and it's going to take time and effort to get to where you want to be.

This was several years before I actually started to study Saturn scientifically, but it was a sight I will never forget.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin clearfix'></div>\n<div class='quote'>\n\"Stay close to subjects that fascinate you personally, but also ask why is the subject important.

Just at that time, <a href='http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/' target='_blank'>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</a> (JPL) scientists bounced a strong radar signal off Saturn's rings, and it was a real puzzle how the rings could reflect radar waves so well, but yet not emit any radio waves. While trying to resolve this puzzle I started to study simple ring dynamics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As there weren't many ring experts at that time, I was invited to join the Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 Imaging Team to work on planning the ring images for the Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune encounters.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I'm inspired professionally by the many thousands of truly outstanding and hardworking scientists all around the world, who are motivated not by personal gain, but by the excitement of learning something new about the world we live in. We rely on each other to contribute different pieces of a big puzzle. And I am inspired personally by anyone who works to make the world around them a better place for everyone.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is a NASA Research Scientist? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to its spaceflight centers, where spacecraft like Cassini are built and operated, NASA also has several research centers that emphasize basic research and instrument development; these studies very often lead to space missions such as Cassini. And I am one of those researchers. For instance, one of my first jobs at the <a href='http://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/home/index.html' target='_blank'>NASA-Ames Research Center</a> (ARC) was to be the lead scientist on the first Titan Probe study.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career. </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It would have to be arriving at JPL for the Voyager 1 Saturn encounter. When I got there I was amazed to see dozens of big media RVs lined up outside JPL. Saturn -- and especially the rings -- was big news! Letting myself into the Imaging Team's area at JPL, I was blown away by how well the images we had planned using my brightness models had turned out -- beautiful, glowing images of the rings in a geometry no one had ever seen. Everyone was ecstatic, including me. It was a great day.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My own career path was not straight by any means, so I'd say be prepared for the unexpected. Stay close to subjects that fascinate you personally, but also ask why is the subject important. Can you tell your friends and family why it's worth your time and their tax money? Respect your colleagues, don't take their skeptical questions as personal insults, and don't be afraid to ask questions of your own. Be aware that you will need, and find, mentors who can help you grow. Have fun!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I enjoy hiking (usually with a camera), making beautiful photos even more beautiful, tending my tomatoes and dwarf fruit tree orchard, and counting waves at the beach. I'm very interested in Paleolithic and Neolithic cultures -- and particularly their mythology.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Learn the basics as best as you can as you go along, even if the ultimate applications are not yet clear.

I became interested in meteorites through a geophysics course I took during my senior year there. The professor, Jim McLelland, a great teacher and geologist, geared the course towards how we determine the composition of the whole Earth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This included lessons learned from meteorites, and this inspired me to learn more about them. I spent my final semester at Stony Brook University (after running out of money for the expensive private school!), which worked out great because I was able to work with Oliver Schaffer, a meteorite expert and great man. After that, I was irrevocably hooked on planetary science.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is a Cosmochemist?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Cosmochemists study meteorites and lunar samples to understand the history of the early solar system&mdash;how it formed, how and when planets formed, the bulk chemical compositions of the planets, and how planetary (and asteroidal) crusts formed and evolved. We use geochemistry, mineralogy, remote sensing, and mathematical modeling.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career.</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I have continuous favorite moments. One of my favorite \"types\" of moments is using data for the first time -- making a plot of this against that, using a set of data nobody else has or looking at a new meteorite sample in the microscope. It is all new and exciting!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Jim McLelland at Colgate inspired me to pursue the geological sciences. Ollie Schaffer at Stony Brook showed me the excitement of using high-tech analytical equipment. Dieter Heymann, my advisor at Rice University, taught me how to do scientific research and gave me a lot of latitude to do it. And John Wood, my advisor when I was a postdoctoral fellow at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, encouraged me to think big. I don't know if I think as big as he does, but he inspired me to unleash my imagination.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Successful planetary scientists need to have strong backgrounds in physics, chemistry and math. Get into research as early as you can, certainly as an undergraduate. Many colleges and universities have opportunities for undergraduate research. Finally, learn how to communicate effectively in both writing and speaking. This is essential so you can tell other scientists what you have discovered and let the public know how you are spending their tax dollars. For example, my colleague Linda Martel and I write and publish a web site devoted to cosmochemistry: Planetary Science Research Discoveries (see link below).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I read books, some nonfiction, many novels and more than a few science books, including the history of science. I like watching movies, both in the theater and at home using DVDs. I enjoy walking in the cool Hawaii mornings on my route that takes me along the ocean.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Learn all you can about science and math, and think about your science all the time. Be open to ideas from fields outside your own: interdisciplinary science will become progressively more important in planetary science and science in general.</p>\r\n",

Read on to hear about her professional journey&mdash;including her early days as a journalist, her stint on <i>Jeopardy!</i>, and that time she crashed an Eskimo wedding...</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>On beginning her career as a local news reporter at the <i>Los Angeles Times:</i></b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><span>I was a local news reporter in the metro section. The city editor&rsquo;s desk was really close to the science editor&rsquo;s desk, so I got to know the science editor just by walking by. It was around the time of </span><span>the</span><span> Spirit and Opportunity landings</span><span> on Mars</span><span>, </span><span>which JPL managed for NASA. T</span><span>he science editor mentioned that he had heard some engineers were wearing specially made watches to </span><span>keep track of </span><span>Mars time (a Mars day is slightly longer than an Earth day). That </span><span>conversation </span><span>resulted in my first front-page feature story about what it was like for earthlings to shift their days according to the Mars clock</span><span>.</span><span> Not long afterward, I formally joined the </span><i>Times</i><span>&rsquo; science section, which gave me an opportunity to write about a shuttle launch, space art, and robotic arms.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<div class='column-width image_module' style=''>\n<figure class='inline_figure'>\n<img alt='Hunting' src='/internal_resources/522'>\n</figure>\n</div>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>That time she crashed an Eskimo wedding in Alaska:</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>One of my favorite journalism stories involved going to the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta on the west coast of Alaska to write about the watch for bird flu. In 2006, biologists and public health officials were worried that the deadly H5N1 flu virus might be carried to America by migratory birds from Asia; those birds often stopped in the delta. We went out to a field research camp with some wildlife biologists who were tracking birds called bar-tailed godwits. And we also spent time in a Yu&rsquo;pik Eskimo village called Kipnuk that subsisted on hunting migratory geese, eider and ducks (as well as fishing in the rivers and gathering tundra berries). We had a great time following around a pair of these subsistence hunters on the spongy tundra, though we almost got stuck out there when their boat&rsquo;s motor wouldn&rsquo;t start. There was one point in Kipnuk when we were looking for people to interview and they had all disappeared. Turns out, everyone was at the wedding at the village&rsquo;s Moravian Church, so we ended up crashing the wedding. The bride and groom were very gracious, though. They invited us to the reception, so we actually got to eat some of the birds we&rsquo;d been learning about. We also learned about Eskimo ice cream (tundra berries, mixed with Crisco and sugar).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Making her way to NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory:</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><span>In 2009, I started wondering what else I might like to do beyond being a newspaper reporter and I remembered all the fun I had writing about JPL. The news chief let me know that there would actually be an opening coming up in a few months, so I took that time to wrap my head around the idea of going from a journalist to being another kind of writer. </span><span>Of all the stories I wrote for the <i>L.A. Times</i>, I </span><span>always loved </span><span>writing </span><span>explanatory stories best, so working at JPL was going to give me an opportunity to do more of what I loved. Plus, there would be the thrill of hearing about discoveries or seeing new images before almost anyone else. Then I could figure out how to share that news with the wider world in the most appealing way possible. </span><span>I started out at JPL as the media rep for NASA&rsquo;s outer solar system missions &ndash; writing press releases for and managing the news for missions such as the Cassini mission to Saturn, the Voyager mission to interstellar space and the Dawn mission to the Asteroid Belt. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<div class='column-width image_module' style=''>\n<figure class='inline_figure'>\n<img alt='Jia-Rui Clean Room' src='/internal_resources/519'>\n</figure>\n</div>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about your job. What do you do?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><span>As the Supervisor of News Events and Projects, </span><span>I coordinate JPL&rsquo;s big news events and help with long-term planning for media relations. In 2017, I spent most of my time working with the Cassini media rep, mission managers, and the mission&rsquo;s public engagement team on how to say <span>a proper </span>goodbye to a spacecraft we were <a href=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=6948\">deliberately plunging into Saturn's atmosphere</a>. We planned a calendar of press releases, feature stories, web videos, <span>news briefings </span>and live TV commentary. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What are some of your day-to-day responsibilities?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><span>When we&rsquo;re several months out from an event, I have a pretty loose schedule. I&rsquo;m basically </span><span>keeping a</span><span> checklist of media-related items that need to be completed for the event, helping to figure out who is doing what, prodding people about </span><span>deadlines</span><span>, updating our list of proposed media products and </span><span>activities</span><span>, and learning as much as I can about the mission. When we get within a few weeks of the event, then the pace really picks up. When we were within weeks of plunging Cassini into Saturn, for example, a typical </span><span>day might involve </span><span>going with the Cassini press officer to a meeting with key mission personnel to </span><span>go over</span><span> our latest media plan </span><span>and to show them our latest web video,</span><span> </span><span>discussing with a mission scientist the part he/she will play in an upcoming news briefing, checking in with the NASA Headquarters Office of Communications, </span><span>helping the producer of our </span><span>plunge-day </span><span>TV show </span><span>plan her interviews, </span><span>and helping members of the news media </span><span>connect with people on the mission they wish to interview</span><span>.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<div class='column-width image_module' style=''>\n<figure class='inline_figure'>\n<img alt='Voyager team' src='/internal_resources/521'>\n</figure>\n</div>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Her single most memorable moment at JPL so far:</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It was the summer of 2013, when I was the media rep for the Voyager mission. I was with Ed Stone, the mission's project scientist, when he came to the conclusion that Voyager 1 had <a href=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2013-277\">crossed the threshold into interstellar space</a>. For the first time, a human-made object flew beyond the plasma bubble our sun blows around itself. Voyager 1 is now bathed in the remnants of the explosions of other stars. I really appreciated seeing the scientific process&mdash;and Ed&rsquo;s mind&mdash;at work. There was quite a bit of debate among members of the science team about whether we had crossed or not. Some indicators pointed to being outside the bubble, but one key indicator hadn&rsquo;t shifted significantly. As Ed and I sat together in the Voyager conference room after a lively telecon with the science team, Ed carefully thought through the meaning of these various indicators. To him, the new data from the Plasma Wave Science (PWS) instrument were the <a href=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2013-278\">clincher</a>. I got chills realizing the historic nature of the moment. </p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>On being an Asian-American woman in the space industry:</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There are always going to be times where you wonder what assumptions other people are making about you, but I would say that, in general, working at NASA has been a very good experience. One thing that was great about working on the Cassini mission was that there were so many other women in leadership positions. Women on that mission spoke their minds. And in JPL&rsquo;s media relations office, I also have some great female managers for colleagues. I would say there are actually more women, Asians, and Asian-Americans working at NASA than in the newsrooms I used to work in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><div class='column-width image_module' style=''>\n<figure class='inline_figure'>\n<img alt='Jia-Rui and Gay' src='/internal_resources/523'>\n</figure>\n</div></span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>You were a contestant on <i>Jeopardy!</i> How did that happen and what was it like?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Near the end of my time as a reporter at the </span><i>L.A. Times</i><span>, the newspaper was going through round after round of layoffs. I was joking to my colleagues that if I got laid off, I could go on </span><i><span>Jeopardy!</span></i><span> and try to earn some money that way. Then I realized, why wait until I was out of work? So I started the process of trying to become a contestant, but it took a few years. By the time I got the call to come in for a taping, I was working at JPL and pregnant with my first baby. I got a couple months&rsquo; postponement. The baby still wasn&rsquo;t sleeping for more than six hours at a stretch, but I didn&rsquo;t want to miss my chance. I did OK</span><span>&mdash;I got second place. I beat the returning champion, but the guy who beat me </span><span>was</span><span> a wizard with the clicker. I couldn&rsquo;t get the timing right and missed out on a lot of answers I knew the questions to. My Achilles&rsquo; heel turned out to be a category called &ldquo;Lunar Fiction.&rdquo; If it were &ldquo;Lunar </span><i>Nonfiction</i><span>,&rdquo; I&rsquo;m convinced I would&rsquo;ve done </span><span>better.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>On her favorite cocktail party story:</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I can usually get a few laughs and shocked faces when I tell people I had a baby in my car. I knew labor would proceed more quickly the second time, but neither I nor my doctor thought my second daughter would come out as abruptly as she did. I was in the car on the way to the hospital when I delivered in rush hour traffic on Beverly Boulevard in Los Angeles. Her birth certificate literally lists the place of birth as &ldquo;automobile.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='column-width image_module' style=''>\n<figure class='inline_figure'>\n<img alt='Jia-Rui Family' src='/internal_resources/520'>\n</figure>\n</div>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do your kids think about your working at NASA?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><span>My </span><span>oldest daughter (who is 6) </span><span>thinks I have the coolest job.</span><span> After she was born, I went back to journalism for a few years and </span><span>I remember </span><span>her </span><span>telling her friends &ldquo;Mommy does computer&rdquo; when they talked about what their parents did at work. When she came to visit me at JPL </span><span>recently</span><span>, I took her to our visitors&rsquo; center where she saw rockets, rovers and other spacecraft. &ldquo;Wow,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I thought your office would look like nothing, but you work with these things that go into actual outer space?&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t have the heart to tell her that most of my days still involve being on a computer. But I have earned some serious points because we build really cool robots and send them to other planets.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What career advice would you give to others?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Everyone is going to have a career transition of one kind or another in their life. Most jobs aren&rsquo;t going to last for 50 years, the way they used to. </span><span>You may have your heart set on </span><span>one </span><span>particular </span><span>job, but you&rsquo;re better off if you can think objectively about the skills you possess and how you can apply them other industries or other roles. I </span><span>went </span><span>from thinking of myself as a journalist to </span><span>seeing myself as </span><span>a writer who can translate complex things. </span><span>T</span><span>hat transition opened up </span><span>a </span><span>door to writing about space and being gobsmacked every day by what nature creates out there&mdash;</span><span>and how humankind makes sense of it</span><span>.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><span>What is your favorite space image and why?</span></h3>\r\n\r\n<div class='column-width image_module' style=''>\n<figure class='inline_figure'>\n<a href='https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08386' target='_self'>\n<img alt='Enceladus' src='/internal_resources/744'>\n</a>\n</figure>\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>If I have to pick only one image that continues to haunt me, it&rsquo;s this one. It's an image of Saturn&rsquo;s moon Enceladus, which Cassini discovered has jets of water ice, organic particles and salt spraying out from its south polar region. Enceladus is an example of why it&rsquo;s so important to go exploring&mdash;before Cassini spent time studying it up-close, we didn&rsquo;t know Enceladus has <a href=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=6812\">nearly all the required ingredients for a habitable world</a>! Under its icy crust, scientists think there is an environment similar to the hydrothermal vents on the floor of Earth&rsquo;s oceans, which are teeming with life. When I look at this picture of Enceladus, I think about what might possibly be swimming under that crust, being sprayed out like free samples into space! If there&rsquo;s life, what might it look like? Will it be a bacterium of some kind? Could it be more complex? Will it look like anything we have on Earth or will it be so different it&rsquo;s beyond our comprehension?</p>\r\n",

Fortunately for me, the companies working on electronic redesign of cash registers were looking for electronic engineering majors and NOT physics majors. I ended up working for the Department of Defense on a contract (my second choice) at General Electric in Philadelphia. Later, my duties expanded to include NASA contract work as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Everybody inspires me! I look up to people who are passionate about what they do and are courageous enough to act on what they know is right in order to make things better.

I did not know what remote sensing was when I got the job, but quickly found out and switched from programming to other aspects of research and applications with satellite data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of my early assignments was to manage the remote terminal network -- users from all over the country, as well as international users, would dial in to our computer system to access specialty remote sensing analysis software. (This was WAY before cloud computing and web apps!) After a few years of working at Purdue, I moved to California and got a job at <a href='http://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/home/index.html' target='_blank'>NASA Ames</a>, in the Earth Science Research Branch which had been a client of our remote terminal network.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My high school geometry teacher. One day, he told me that I was \"good in math.\" This astonished me, but gave me the inspiration and the direction to major in mathematics at Purdue -- majoring in math enabled me to get that first job. I have no idea what I would have majored in if he had not said those words to me!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is a Program Executive?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Program executives are assigned to spacecraft development missions in the Science Mission Directorate (SMD). We represent the mission at NASA Headquarters (HQ) and to all of the stakeholders who continuously need data and make decisions about the mission. We serve as an advocate and an enforcer for each mission, which may be under development at a NASA field center or other external organization or in science operations. We continually oversee the progress made by the mission. We also ensure that the mission has access to all of the resources they need, and are prepared for the various stages of development and gate reviews between phases. We are the mission's eyes, ears and legs at NASA HQ. Currently, I am the Program Executive for LADEE, JUICE (the European Space Agency's JUpiter's ICy Moons Explorer), and Europa Clipper.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career.</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Two favorite past projects:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1) Leading a task to research and develop applications and then teach Robert Mondavi Winery staff to use satellite and aircraft data to monitor the development of phyloxera, a root louse, that was destroying Napa and Sonoma vineyards. It was such a non-typical NASA effort at that time, and the public was amazed that NASA would help in this area. It was very rewarding to be a part of this project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2) Leading a project to test newly developed thermal protection materials on a Minute Man missile. We found a very inexpensive piggy-back ride on a test missile from the Air Force, which allowed us to perform the experiment at a small fraction of the costs of other opportunities to test in space. We flew twice: The first time we did this, it only took us five months from getting the project funded to actually flying the test aboard the missile. I am still very proud to have accomplished this. We couldn't have done it without our partners from the Sandia National Laboratory.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Don't be afraid to try new areas. I was in the Earth sciences remote sensing area for 15 years before venturing out. Even though my first step into a new area was not fulfilling, it taught me that I could enter a new area, learn, contribute and succeed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since then I have had the opportunity to move around a fair amount, and each experience has been valuable. Sometimes the politics can be a bit ugly, but going through difficult times allows you to appreciate the good times even more. Regardless of how well-balanced your work- and non-work life is, you will spend many, many hours/weeks/months/years on the job, so make sure you enjoy it enough to want to come to work (nearly) every day. And if you end up in a job where you don't look forward to coming to work, it is time to make a change.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I am one of those people who enjoys exercise: I run a few half marathons each year with friends, which is a lot of fun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My husband and I started taking horseback riding lessons together every week two years ago, which is fun. This has led to several Dude Ranch vacations. Galloping through open fields of wild lilies and jumping over streams is quite thrilling!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I also enjoy the Washington D.C. live-theater offerings quite a bit, and kayaking and paddle boarding when I get a chance.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>With a strong technical education, there are endless numbers of fascinating areas you can work in. And even though technology will change and brand new fields that we haven't even heard of yet will emerge after you are finished with school, having this technical foundation will open many doors for you in the future.</p>\r\n",

Since at the time, NASA funding was tight and many space technologists were becoming health specialists or fence painters, I decided on a degree program in computer science.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin clearfix'></div>\n<div class='quote'>\n\"It is never too late to discover your life's passion, and once you have made this discovery, it is never too soon to start pursuing it.\"\n</div>\n<footer>\n<cite>- John Lawrence Bresina</cite>\n</footer>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin'></div>\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>As an undergraduate, I majored in both mathematics and computer science, with a specialization in artificial intelligence (AI). My M.S. and Ph.D. degrees were both in computer science, again with a specialization in AI. The field of AI encompasses a broad range of research, including game playing, speech understanding, vision, cognitive modeling, problem solving, search methods, planning, scheduling, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I got a job as a NASA contractor at the <a href='http://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/home/index.html' target='_blank'>NASA-Ames Research Center</a> (ARC) within the Artificial Intelligence branch in 1988, and 10 years later I became a civil servant.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Initially, it was the Apollo astronauts that I saw on television, as well as the scientists and engineers that made their journeys into space possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is a Computer Scientist?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My official NASA job title is Computer Scientist, which covers a wide range of possible jobs. The majority of what I've done at NASA is research in AI, specifically in the area of planning and scheduling, and how to apply these AI technologies to space missions. More recently, I've worked directly on space missions as part of the mission operations staff employing the technologies that I helped to develop.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career.</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The first highlight of my NASA career was contributing to the Mars Exploration Rover (MER) mission. I was part of a joint team from ARC and the <a href='http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/' target='_blank'>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</a> (JPL) that developed a software system called MAPGEN, which got selected to help the tactical activity planners schedule the daily activities of the two rovers, Spirit and Opportunity. This was the first time that the fruits of my (and others') research and development were going to be directly used on a space mission. That in itself was exciting, but then I was asked to join the MER missions' operation team at JPL, as one of the six original tactical activity planners. It was an amazing experience to work with world-famous planetary scientists and expert space operations engineers! It was the fulfillment of my high school dream of working on a space mission.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second highlight was playing a critical role in a recent lunar mission, called the Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite (LCROSS). I was the lead of the Activity Planning and Sequencing System. I was responsible for constructing the command sequences executed on the spacecraft, as well as the command procedures which were executed on the ground by the flight controllers. It was a very intense, exciting experience; thankfully, all the hard work yielded a highly successful mission!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A surprising variety of educational backgrounds can be the basis for contributing to space exploration and having a NASA career. Find an area that inspires you and explore how expertise in that area can further space exploration.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Music has always been a passion of mine outside of work, both as an avid concert-goer and as a singer-songwriter. More recently, I have become a film-buff. There are many other activities I enjoy, including getting away from technology (all of it) by hiking in silence through Nature's wonders.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Be sure to take advantage of the many educational and internship opportunities that NASA offers students. It is never too late to discover your life's passion, and once you have made this discovery, it is never too soon to start pursuing it.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><b>Read More </b><br />\r\n*<a href='http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/home/index.html' target='_blank'>The MER Mission Site</a><br />\r\n*<a href='http://zipcodemars.jpl.nasa.gov/bio-contribution.cfm?bid=316&amp;cid=282&amp;pid=274&amp;country_id=US&amp;state_id=CA' target='_blank'>John Bresina's Role on the MER Mission</a><br />\r\n*<a href='http://lcross.arc.nasa.gov/' target='_blank'>The LCROSS Mission Site</a><br />\r\n*<a href='http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/LADEE/main/' target='_blank'>LADEE (Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer) Mission Site</a><br />\r\n*<a href='http://marsprogram.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/' target='_blank'>Mars Science Laboratory Mission Site</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Links to Videos, stories, etc.</b><br />\r\n*<a href='http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/videogallery/index.html?media_id=11463003' target='_blank'>Video of LCROSS Lunar Impact</a></p>\r\n",

      "body": "<h3><b>Where are you from? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I was born in Fargo, N.D., but I mostly grew up in Bullhead City, Ariz. I've been living in the San Francisco Bay Area since 1997 and I don't plan on leaving anytime soon.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin clearfix'></div>\n<div class='quote'>\n\"With every interaction, I try to learn and implement what I can from whomever I can.\"\n</div>\n<footer>\n<cite>- John McCormick</cite>\n</footer>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin'></div>\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Describe the first time you made a personal connection with outer space. </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>To be honest, I never really thought about space too much before I started working at <a href='http://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/home/index.html' target='_blank'>NASA Ames Research Center</a> (ARC). Of course as a boy I played at being an astronaut, but I didn't really think about it as a career option until I was an adult. It wasn't until I was a part of the Lunar CRater Observation and Sensing Satellite (LCROSS) mission that I began to connect with space.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Early on at Ames, I remember attending a meeting in which they were discussing some flight dynamics aspects of the mission. I remember thinking to myself that working on spacecraft is pretty cool -- it certainly beats anything else I had done previously.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>How did you end up working in the space program? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It really was a surprise to me that I ended up working for NASA. Prior to working at Ames, I had spent 10 years working mostly as a product manager for mobile-phone software (address books and the like). I had no space experience. It happened that someone I had worked with previously was working for Ames and had recommended me for a position on the LCROSS mission. I was called in for an interview and a few days later I was working at Ames.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My father has been an inspiration to me on many levels, and provided an example of the type of man I should strive to be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Professionally, I've had many mentors from whom I have drawn knowledge and inspiration, so it's hard to point to just one or even a few. I've had the fortune of working for and with some very intelligent and talented individuals. With every interaction, I try to learn and implement what I can from whomever I can.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is an Integration and Test (I&T) Manager?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Every spacecraft project has an integration and test phase, and hence an I&T manager (in role, if not in title).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A spacecraft is an assembly of subsystems (propulsion for example) and components (star tracker, battery, etc.). These components are provided by a variety of vendors and are typically delivered independently from one another. As they are delivered, I&T is responsible for assembling all of the components together according to the designs provided by the spacecraft engineers. That's the \"Integration\" part. I&T is also responsible for testing the spacecraft (hence the \"& Test\") to ensure it can survive the launch and space environments. This testing includes both functional testing (making sure the various components work together and can perform the tasks necessary to complete the mission), and environmental testing (subjecting the spacecraft to launch and space environments to prove it can survive and still perform adequately). Typical roles on the I&T team include mechanical tech, electrical tech, test script developer, and test conductor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An I&T manager is ultimately responsible for delivering the fully assembled and ready-to-launch spacecraft to the launch provider. He or she is primarily tasked with the administrative aspects of that effort: assembling the team, creating and tracking budgets and schedules, setting priorities, and reporting at the various reviews.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&T managers have to interact with many parties (both within and outside the project) in order to coordinate support resources: including personnel, equipment and facilities. I&T managers are usually involved in anomaly resolution and change-control board meetings as well. (So, yes, they spend a lot of time in meetings.) The position isn't all administrative though. There are also technical aspects to the job, including providing input on spacecraft designs to accommodate I&T activities, creating/reviewing test procedures, participating in troubleshooting activities, and sometimes serving as a test director.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career. </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I have a lot of fond memories from both LCROSS and Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE). Top of my list would have to be being at the <a href='http://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/home/index.html' target='_blank'>Kennedy Space Center</a> (KSC) for the LCROSS launch in June 2009. KSC had set up a VIP area where my family and I, and several LCROSS team members, stood to watch the launch.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe launch was set for the late afternoon and waiting all day had been agonizing, especially since anticipation had made the time seem to crawl. When the launch window finally arrived, storm clouds appeared on the horizon. Due to the clouds, the first of three launch times was scrubbed in hopes that the clouds would pass. Unfortunately, the second launch time was also scrubbed as the clouds approached even closer. As the sky grew completely overcast, I thought for sure that the launch was going to be delayed a third and final time. (This would mean we'd have to go through the same waiting torture the next day.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Miraculously, despite the cloud cover being worse than when the first launch time was delayed, we received the green light to launch: 10, 9, 8, 7, 6 ... time hit 0 and the rocket ignited. As the Atlas carrying LCROSS started to lift off, we could feel the bleachers vibrate from the force despite being four miles away. I felt a mixture of relief, awe, pride, and exhilaration wash over me as I watched the rocket soar into the clouds -- definitely one of my favorite moments. I am looking forward to experiencing a similar moment when LADEE launches in September 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I'm not sure I'd advise someone to take the same career path as mine given the winding nature of the path that brought me here. However, if you are looking to be an I&T manager, I'd advise you to diversify your skills. Some folks may be tempted to focus only on the technical aspects, spending all their time learning about science or engineering. However, being a good manager entails much more than just a solid technical understanding. You'll need to know how to create and manage schedules and budgets, deal with contracts and proposals, and present to management and large audiences. I'd also suggest taking some software development courses. The vast majority of spacecraft testing is actually testing Flight Software (FSW), so a basic understanding of software concepts is highly beneficial.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I like to golf and spend time with my family. The latter doesn't leave much time for the former, but as my kids get a little older I plan to combine the two.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I have a mathematics degree and it has served me well throughout my career. I think math, science and engineering give you core capabilities that you can leverage regardless of what you actually end up doing. Also as a hiring manager, I know that I prioritize individuals who hold those degrees over ones that are less scientific. So, my advice to you would be to pursue a degree in one of those areas. But as I mentioned above, I'd suggest diversifying your studies so they are more balanced, which will give you the flexibility to fill more roles.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><b>Read More: </b><br />\r\n*<a href='http://moon.nasa.gov/home.cfm' target='_blank'>NASA's Moon Site</a><br />\r\n*<a href='http://lcross.arc.nasa.gov/' target='_blank'>LCROSS Mission Site</a><br />\r\n*<a href='http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/LADEE/main/index.html' target='_blank'>LADEE Mission Page</a><br />\r\n*<a href='http://science.nasa.gov/missions/ladee/' target='_blank'>LADEE Mission Page on NASA Science</a><br />\r\n*<a href='http://esc.gsfc.nasa.gov/267/271.html' target='_blank'>Lunar Laser Communication Demonstration (LLCD) Website</a></p>\r\n",

Grunsfeld was named associate administrator for the Science Mission Directorate at <a href='http://www.nasa.gov/' target='_blank'>NASA Headquarters</a> (HQ) in Washington, D.C. in January 2012. Dr. Grunsfeld's background includes research in high energy astrophysics, cosmic ray physics and in the emerging field of <a href='PLANET:Beyond' target='_blank'>exoplanet</a> studies with specific interest in future astronomical instrumentation.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a child, John dreamed of becoming an astronaut. He studied science and his dream came true. A veteran of five space flights, STS-67 (1995), STS-81 (1997), STS-103 (1999) STS-109 (2002) and STS-125 (2009), John has logged more than 58 days in space, including 58 hours and 30 minutes of extravehicular activities (EVA) in eight spacewalks. He visited the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) three times as an astronaut to service and upgrade the observatory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>John earned his bachelor's degree in physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1980. Returning to his native Chicago, he earned a master's degree and, in 1988, a doctorate in physics from the University of Chicago. His doctoral thesis was based on a cosmic ray experiment on the space shuttle Challenger. He then joined the faculty of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) as a senior research fellow in physics, mathematics and astronomy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>John joined NASA's astronaut corps in 1992. He qualified for flight selection as a mission specialist and was assigned as the lead for the development of portable computers for use in space.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He first flew to space aboard Endeavour in March 1995 on a mission that studied the far ultraviolet spectra of faint astronomical objects using the Astro-2 Observatory. His second flight was aboard Atlantis in January 1997. This mission docked with the Russian space station Mir, exchanged U.S. astronauts living aboard the outpost and performed scientific research using the Biorack payload. John flew on three more shuttle missions -- Discovery in December 1999, Columbia in March 2002 (payload commander) and Atlantis in May 2009 (lead spacewalker in charge of Hubble activities) -- that successfully serviced and upgraded HST.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the 1999 mission, he served as NASA's chief of extravehicular activity. John also was an instructor in the Extravehicular Activity Branch and Robotics Branch of the astronaut program and worked on the exploration concepts and technologies for use beyond low <a href='PLANET:Earth' target='_blank'>Earth</a> orbit in the Advanced Programs Branch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2004 and 2005, John was the commander and science officer on the backup crew for Expedition 13 to the International Space Station (ISS). He also served as the NASA Chief Scientist detailed to NASA HQ from 2003 to 2004. In this position, he helped develop President George W. Bush's \"Vision for Space Exploration.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He retired from NASA in December 2009 and served as deputy director for the Space Telescope Science Institute, in Baltimore, Md., managing the science program for HST and its partner in the forthcoming James Webb Space Telescope. He returned to NASA in January 2012 as the associate administrator of the Science Mission Directorate at NASA HQ in Washington. One facet of John's duties as associate administrator is representing NASA's current and future space science programs and projects to Congress, the media and the public.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>John and his wife Carol have two children. Some of his favorite pastimes include: mountaineering, flying, sailing, bicycling and music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Awards and Recognitions:</b><br />\r\n*W.D.

It sounded good, so I bought it at a bookstore and I read it. I was totally fascinated. This book just put all the pieces together for me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And I was such a pain, I must have been reading this book out loud in the house, so my mother finally said, 'Why don't you write to professor Sagan and tell him how excited you are about the book?' And I said, 'He's never going to reply to a junior high school student.' So she pushed me. I wrote the letter and asked him what was the best way to become an astronomer. He wrote me back, a two-page letter which really inspired me. We corresponded several times after that as well. Later, we worked together on Cassini.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fact there was a famous planetary scientist with the vision laid out in his book, who would communicate with a junior high school student, really impressed me. It opened the door to make me realize I could really be a planetary scientist.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>How did you end up working in the space program?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>When you are in college, you tend to focus on the academic part. I was a mainstream physics and astronomy major. At that point, taking the courses, I could have ended up doing anything in astronomy, including looking through telescopes. But in my junior year - I was a still a subscriber to Sky & Telescope - I picked up the latest issue on the way to my stellar atmospheres class and the cover had an approach picture of Jupiter from Voyager 1. This was 1979. And I just stared at that picture. I hadn?t see anything so clear and so beautiful as that. Much better than Pioneer or ground based telescopes. And at that point, I thought to myself this what I really want to do -- I want to work with these planetary spacecraft. That was my trajectory toward getting involved in space missions.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='image_module right' style='width: Color image of man on skis in snow.px;'>\n<figure class='inline_figure'>\n<img src='/images/content/Lunine_skis.jpg'>\n<figcaption>\nWhen he's not exploring other worlds or moon, Jonathan enjoys explore the wilderness on cross country skis.\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What was your first mission?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I was asked to help out with the Ultraviolet Spectrometer (UVS) solar occultation of Triton. This was 1989, Voyager 2's encounter with Neptune. The UVS data were very interesting, but to be honest I snuck over to where the imaging team was and watched these incredible pictures of Triton come in. And I thought that was totally cool.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Carl Sagan certainly inspired me. I would say that, of all the astronomers of that generation, really he was the one. In graduate school, my thesis advisor, David Stevenson, was an inspiration. He was so good at physics and so focused and able to really get to the heart of these problems. He really taught me how to do science. In the early 1980s, Charles Elachi invited a bunch of people to brainstorm about what a Titan radar should be like. I got involved and that was one of my early entries into Cassini. Charles has been an important inspiration ever since.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What does your job entail?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I am the David C. Duncan Professor in the Physical Sciences at Cornell, which was the chair that Carl held. He was the first to hold that chair. I am currently the director of the Cornell Center for Astrophysics and Planetary Science.. So those are the administrative things. Of course I teach. I have graduate students. I guide undergraduate students. My research component is strongly focused on planetary missions and what we learn from them. I have always had an astrophysical component in my research. I have worked on brown dwarfs, failed stars. That sort of morphed into working on exoplanets when those were discovered. I have an involvement in James Webb Space Telescope, as an interdisciplinary scientist not only for solar system, but actually extrasolar planets.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career.</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Probably the most magical moment was when the Huygens probe successfully returned its data after landing on Titan, and we were about the get the images - the first images of the surface of Titan that anyone had seen close up. It was night. It was dark, winter in Darmstadt, Germany. There were about 20 of us in trailer reserved for the imaging team, led by Martin Tomasko of the University of Arizona.. The pictures start coming down. They are flashed on a screen as thumbnails, a couple of hundred of them total. They were sort of randomly ordered, one every second. Some were featureless, but then suddenly you'd started seeing the haze clear. You'd see a landform. You'd see gullies. You'd see what looked like islands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No human had ever seen this landscape before. And the 20 of us were the ones who were seeing it exclusively. And we were all screaming with excitement. And for a period of maybe 20 minutes, half hour, we were the only ones to see this alien world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We spent the rest of the night putting these images, these small pictures together, into a mosaic. It was kind of an eerie experience. It was a totally alien environment. Assembling this jigsaw puzzle of little pieces was a very interesting exercise - almost, I have to say, creepy. The more we pieced together the more alien it looked.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Make contact with someone in the field. If you are a high school student, write to a professional planetary scientist. Not all will write back. But just be persistent. Make that personal contact. Ask them how they got into the field. Try to see a potential model for yourself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You really have to do the physics and geology and chemistry courses. The academics are so important that you can't skimp on those. That's really crucial.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Be persistent. You've got to recognize that there are ups and downs and there are more downs than ups. Things take a lot longer than you'd like them to and you just have to be persistent.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My wife and I cross country and downhill ski. That's a lot of fun. And, in the summer, I like to bicycle. I have a fascination with history, philosophy, theology. I read those books not quite for relaxation, but as a sort of the other side of the coin - a different take on reality than science.</p>\r\n",

I was also excited when Voyager encountered Saturn, but the Neptune encounter is something I very much remember because I was 14 at the time. This encounter was timely for me because it determined my choice to study more science during high school. I still feel that both the Voyager missions have been very special missions: their observations gave rise to many questions, which have in part driven the past twenty years of space exploration.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin clearfix'></div>\n<div class='quote'>\n\"It's really a privilege to work in this field. It's a lot of work, but it's very rewarding work.\"\n</div>\n<footer>\n<cite>- Julie Castillo-Rogez</cite>\n</footer>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin'></div>\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>How did you end up working in the space program? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I never thought that I would actually be doing planetary research: I graduated with a degree in geology and did a Ph.D. in terrestrial seismology at Nantes University. This was at the time when a new planetary science laboratory was implemented at Nantes University. Looking back, it was a particularly good thing to have benefited from a background in geology before becoming involved in planetary studies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then I met a Cassini scientist in 2000 who hired me right after I graduated to do science planning engineering for the Cassini mission. I also got to brainstorm a little bit about the Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter (JIMO) mission, the Titan and Saturn System mission and some Enceladus orbiter concepts.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I have met a lot of very inspiring people. In terms of role models, Bonnie Buratti and Linda Spilker immediately come to mind. Dennis Matson has been a great mentor. He should write a book on mentoring, seriously.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Torrence Johnson inspired my research. I remember a presentation he made a long time ago where he mentioned that one should not forget the small bodies (the \"potatoes\") as an important research focus. I was hooked!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have been lucky to work with the most competent team during the development of the <a href='http://www.jpl.nasa.gov' target='_blank'>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</a>'s (JPL) Ice Physics Lab.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is a Planetary Geophysicist? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Planetary geophysics covers a lot of sub-disciplines. Most of my work is about modeling the internal evolution of the so called \"small bodies\" or \"primitive bodies.\" Well, most of those bodies are neither small nor primitive! It is very exciting to extract the information these objects reveal about the early history of the solar system and the origin of water in the inner solar system. There are many small bodies -- many data points. Each contributes a different piece of the puzzle, and I am having fun trying to put these pieces together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For this, I use different techniques. First, I try to couple various processes or properties, for example to see how the chemistry of an object affects its physical evolution, and vice-versa. In order to do that, I work with a lot of collaborators who bring their unique expertise to this interdisciplinary research. Another part of my research is about measuring in the laboratory some input parameters that I can use in models, in order to shed light on processes that are poorly understood right now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A large part of all research is also about communicating the results to a broad audience -- colleagues, sponsors and to all ages of the public.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career. </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I have had the chance to work in missions, which is obviously a privilege, but I must say the most exciting moment was when my colleagues in the Ice Physics Lab and I realized that our project was going to perform far beyond our expectations. We tried to push the limits of the setup, until we realized that we could simulate conditions similar to those expected on Europa! At that point, we were absolutely ecstatic, because how often do lab experiments end up working better than expected? Still, we knew that the system would need some updates in order to yield research-grade results. 18 months after starting that project, we decided to pull it entirely apart and start another 18 months of development. (When I present about this facility, I use a picture of my kid as a reference: when we started, my kid was just born, when we finished he was three years old.) Those three years were probably the most exciting three years of my entire life!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A problem I have had is that it took me a very long time to find out on which topic I would focus my career. I have worked on Europa, Titan, asteroids, laboratory work, mission design, Mars, astrobiology, and material physics. However, I would not claim that I am an astrobiologist or a mission designer, or that I qualify to be part of a mission to Mars. That is the problem of being interested in many topics and getting the opportunity to work on all of them! I am not saying that it is necessarily a bad thing to have broad-based expertise, but it clearly took me a while to obtain enough results in a particular area for that research to become marketable, i.e., to obtain funding in order to be able to carry out that research to the next level.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I am a soccer mom!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>For those students who are interested in planetary science, I would recommend that besides math and physics they should also get a solid background in natural science, including hands-on geology. Simply put, in order to be able to have an understanding of other planetary bodies, one should first be able to understand what the Earth is made of, where it comes from and how it evolved to its current state.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><b>Read More:</b><br />\r\n*<a href='http://science.jpl.nasa.gov/people/Castillo/' target='_blank'>Julie's JPL Profile</a><br />\r\n*<a href='http://scienceandtechnology.jpl.nasa.gov/research/facilities/ices/' target='_blank'>Ice Physics Laboratory Page</a><br />\r\n*<a href='http://womeninplanetaryscience.wordpress.com/2011/02/24/julie-castillo-rogez-all-bits-of-experience-are-meaningful-and-will-prove-useful-in-the-end/' target='_blank'>Julie's Feature on Women in Planetary Science</a></p>\r\n",

I recall torturing my poor mother with trips to the library to do my \"research\" as early as three years old, and trying to commit books on solar system astronomy to memory. The first phenomenon I was really interested in researching at the library was the aurora borealis, which I had seen once and which thrilled me to no end. By age eight, my obsession with stars and rocks was painfully obvious to anyone who met me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Voyager 2 reached Neptune, I was freaking out over the reports of pink snow on Triton and wanted nothing less than ground truth. Instead of hanging posters of bands or hot guys on my walls, I slept under photos of the Saturnian system and lunar maps. I would comb asteroid lists looking for names for my future first-born. (FYI: I am expecting my first child this year, who will in fact be given the names of an asteroid and a moon that I picked out back in 1986.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, my first personal connections with outer space probably had to do with having more opportunities than most other kids my age to see the night sky. Since my parents were in college or graduate school for most of my childhood and my father worked until three or four in the morning, our household was naturally shifted to the night-time hours and we engaged in cheap forms of entertainment, such as low-tech stargazing. As a kid, I could never sleep before midnight (still can't), so I'd just stay up at night thinking, or staring out my window, and this evolved into thinking too hard about what I was staring at.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><blockquote>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin clearfix'></div>\n<div class='quote'>\n\"I pretty much came out of the womb </span><span>knowing that I was interested in space </span><span>science, with 'interest' being an under</span><span>statement: it's either this or insanity.\"\n</div>\n<footer>\n<cite>- Karly Pitman</cite>\n</footer>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin'></div>\n</blockquote></span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>How did you end up working in the space program? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Actually connecting to the planetary science community took effort.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I double majored in astronomy and geology, as planned, at Vassar and had about four great advisers at any given time. However, I didn't have a major professor who specialized in planetary science. So, during my junior year I asked my geology professor for a copy of the American Geophysical Union (AGU) directory and sent out cold-call emails to anyone and everyone with a planetary science affiliation for advice on graduate schools. Several people were kind enough to respond, including Mike Gaffey (then at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI)), Carle Pieters and Jim Head at Brown, and Adrian Brearley and Rhian Jones at the Institute of Meteoritics. These scientists wrote back to me several times with good feedback, provided background on asteroids and meteorites, and generously loaned me samples for my senior thesis work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of my letters of recommendation for grad school were from astronomers, and that, coupled with advice received from the \"planetary e-mail campaign,\" landed me in an interstellar dust group within a computational physics department at Louisiana State University (LSU).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My adviser at LSU, Geoff Clayton, was open to working with me on a dissertation about light scattering in planetary regolith. He introduced me to his collaborator, Mike Wolff, who was then doing atmospheric radiative transfer work for Mars missions (MARCI, CRISM, MER, etc.). Mike hired me on planetary grants through the Space Science Institute, set me up with the tools of the trade and helped me to network with other planetary scientists when I began presenting at conferences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Josh Bandfield and the folks at Arizona State University (ASU) were the first to really give me exposure in working with Mars mission data and lab and field spectrometers. Allan Treiman at the Lunar and Planetary Institute (LPI) provided me with access to planetary science facilities and meteorite projects closer to home.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is a Research Scientist? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My official job title is research scientist. Research scientists make a living by developing ideas and serving as principal investigators on grants and contracts. Research scientists can work in universities, national labs or other institutes, like mine, which is a soft-money nonprofit company. I am a theorist/experimentalist, so I do scientific experiments and computer calculations, as well as manage project budgets and people. Right now, I am leading four grant projects and assisting on a fifth. Usually, I spend each day of the week on a different project or work on several projects per day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My research specialties are in planetary science and astrophysics. A planetary scientist is someone who studies solar systems (either our own or others) and also anything found in a solar system, e.g., planets, moons, asteroids, meteorites, comets, dust. Planetary scientists are generally hybrid experts in astronomy, geology, chemistry, physics, and/or biology. Astrophysicists focus more on how physics is applied to astronomical objects like stars, galaxies, the interstellar medium, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career. </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The first time I won a grant made me very happy. It's almost like winning an Academy Award because your peers vote on whether you win or lose (therefore, it is a major honor and acknowledgment that your work is important). Since science funding is limited, the odds are very small that you'll win, so it's also a relief to know that you'll be gainfully employed.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There wasn't one person who inspired me to become a scientist; I always knew that I was one, even before I knew the word for it. But I'd like to acknowledge the efforts of my parents in making sure that my dream of working in the space program became a reality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My parents are not scientists or engineers, but they (and especially my mother) always took my desire to be a space scientist seriously and had good instincts that put me on the right path to becoming one (e.g., telling me very early on that I would need a Ph.D.; making sure that Santa brought me planetariums, microscopes, chemistry sets, geology books, and math toys every year; raising me to be tough and to not give up).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My grandfather, who was the vice-president of a rock quarry, provided early encouragement for my love of rocks and minerals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My mother's cousin Nancy, who is a chemist and patent attorney, has provided great advice as a steady pen pal and supporter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am also inspired by my friends who ended up making their childhood dreams a reality and especially my friends and colleagues who work under extreme obstacles.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The basic career path for a scientist looks like this:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>High School Diploma -> Bachelor's Degree -> Master's Degree (Optional) -> Ph.D. -> Postdoctoral Appointment(s) (Optional) -> PI = Real Job</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(You can exit this path at any one of the arrows; I went straight through with no breaks.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PI stands for Principal Investigator; this title designates that you are able to support yourself (and others) financially to do science research. PI status is a championship title that you have to fight to hold every year (think of every grant win as an Olympic gold medal) and is essential for employment as a scientist no matter what company or country you will eventually work in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, it's critical to build your entrepreneurial skills in tandem with your scientific knowledge, as well as becoming a world-renowned expert in at least one area (by publishing papers in professional journals, giving conference presentations and letting people know informally what you bring to the table).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most successful scientists are originals (i.e., not clones of their advisers), who have diversified their knowledge base and who consistently deliver quality products on time -- those are the qualities I'd recommend striving for.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My current hobbies and interests include: designing and sewing my own clothing, dessert production/consumption, dreaming about hand-to-hand combat and someday owning a MP5 rifle, volunteering for early career and women in science initiatives, and reading comparative literature -- all of which are fairly delightful.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>First, I would issue a caveat that advice is merely an opinion born of someone's own experiences and hopes or fears for you. Following someone's advice to the letter rather than following your own gut instinct is a bad idea, especially for someone considering a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) career, where self-reliance is important.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For students interested in STEM, first figure out exactly how interested you are in STEM: enough to go pro (i.e., pull long work hours or move wherever in the world there is a job)? If you enjoy the subject matter, but aren't sure you want that lifestyle, then check out different career options (e.g. at the <a href='http://aas.org/career/nonacademic.php' target='_blank'>American Astronomical Society Non-Academic Astronomers Network</a> website).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you don't mind the career demands of a straight research or teaching career, then I'd recommend excelling in science and math coursework, as well as taking electives in other areas that will help with writing and public speaking. STEM careers involve a lot of competition (individual and team), so sign up for as many tournaments as possible and challenge yourself academically to maintain your edge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And because becoming a scientist is a lifelong marathon where it's possible to work into your 90s, be sure to take breaks for fun and exercise along the way.</p>\r\n",

      "body": "<h3><b>Where are you from?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I was born in Denver, Colo. and grew up in Broomfield (near Boulder) -- a city which was a small town, but has grown a lot in the past 20 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin clearfix'></div>\n<div class='quote'>\n\"Working in planetary science is an<br />\r\nopportunity to go beyond a single<br />\r\ndiscipline and immerse oneself in a<br />\r\nrange of scientific studies without limits!\"\n</div>\n<footer>\n<cite>- Kathy Mandt</cite>\n</footer>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin'></div>\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Describe the first time you made a personal connection with outer space. </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The first launch of the Space Shuttle occurred when I was in elementary school. I was so excited about this event, and when I later saw the astronauts in space I wanted to join them. Since I have asthma, I cannot qualify for the astronaut program, but as a planetary scientist I have the opportunity to explore our <a href='PLANET:SolarSys' target='_blank'>solar system</a> on a daily basis.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>How did you end up working in the space program? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I took a very non-traditional path into the space program. After high school I joined the military to earn money for college and to take advantage of the G.I. Bill. While stationed in Japan I met and married my husband, and after seven years of service I separated from the military. My husband remained on active duty for 20 years, so I followed him wherever his career took us. When we were assigned to the U.S. Embassy in Sofia, Bulgaria, I began to take courses through a distance program with the University of North Dakota in order to obtain my Master of Science in Space Studies. (This distance program caters to military members and their family.) It was through this program that I had my first opportunity to be a part of planetary research. For my thesis I studied the geologic origin of the Medusae Fossae formation on <a href='PLANET:Mars' target='_blank'>Mars</a>. After returning to the U.S., I was given the opportunity to work as a graduate student for Hunter Waite with the Cassini Ion Neutral Mass Spectrometer team at Southwest Research Institute. This has been an amazing opportunity.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is a Planetary Scientist? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Planetary scientists are difficult to define. In fact, as a survey (see below) recently conducted by the American Astronomical Society Division for Planetary Science (AAS-DPS) shows, we describe ourselves in a variety of ways. Since planetary scientists study entire planets, we need to have an interdisciplinary understanding of science. We typically specialize in one area, such as atmospheric science or geology. However, we have to understand the interactions between atmospheres and surfaces, chemistry, and the physics occurring beyond a planet's atmosphere. Working in planetary science is an opportunity to go beyond a single discipline and immerse oneself in a range of scientific studies without limits!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career. </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I have had a lot of wonderful experiences, even though I've only been working in planetary science for a short time. Conferences are a great opportunity to share your work and meet people who you admire for their work. The most enjoyable conference that I've attended was the AAS-DPS annual meeting which was held in Nantes, France. I had the opportunity to meet Daniel Gautier, a well-known scientist who championed the Cassini mission in its early days. It was an honor to discuss my research with him and find out that he was interested in the work that I am doing as a planetary scientist.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the most inspirational people I've encountered since beginning work in planetary science is <a href='Person:NieburS' target='_blank'>Susan Niebur</a>. I never had the opportunity to meet her in person, but we had several exchanges by email. She was devoted to building a community for women within planetary science and her work has inspired me to carry on through challenging times, and to help other women, and early career scientists (young men included), to achieve their greatest potential.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Because I took such a non-traditional path, I hope to serve as an example to others who may feel that they are too old to go after their dreams. It took me 20 years to complete my Ph.D., but I had the opportunity during this long journey to spend time at home with my children while they were young. Delaying my career because of family constraints didn't end my career opportunities. Others who have made the same choices should know that there are still opportunities available to them to achieve their goals.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My two teenagers are my pride and joy. I love watching my daughter play volleyball and I enjoy going scuba diving with my son. I also like watching the videos my son makes, including a commercial for our local scuba diving shop. On my own, I like to read and play piano.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Pursuing a career in science, math or engineering is very challenging. There is, of course, the intellectual challenge involved with learning math, science and engineering, but there are other challenges as well. As a scientist, communication is very important. For example, I can make the most amazing scientific discovery, but it will never bear fruit unless I am able to communicate this discovery to other scientists through oral presentations and written publications. It is also very important to share our research with the public. Our work is, ultimately, a public service intended to improve education and quality of life for our society. My advice to a student interested in math, science or engineering is to focus your energy on learning to communicate well because it is a vital skill for success in this field.<br />\r\n </p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><b>Read More:</b><br />\r\n*<a href='http://womeninplanetaryscience.wordpress.com/2010/09/07/kathleen-mandt/' target='_blank'>Kathy's Women in Planetary Science Interview: \"A Nontraditional Start\"</a><br />\r\n*<a href='http://caps.space.swri.edu/inms/inms.html ' target='_blank'>Cassini Ion Neutral Mass Spectrometer Website</a><br />\r\n*<a href='http://dps.aas.org/files/surveyresultsbusinessmeeting.pdf' target='_blank'>The American Astronomical Society Division for Planetary Science (AAS-DPS) Survey</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Links to Videos, Stories, etc. </b><br />\r\n*<a href='http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/cassini/whycassini/factory20120420.html ' target='_blank'>\"NASA Research Estimates How Long Titan's Chemical Factory Has Been in Business\"</a><br />\r\n*<a href='http://swri.org/9what/releases/2012/titan.htm ' target='_blank'>\"SwRI Scientists Assess Age of Titan's Organic Atmosphere\"</a><br />\r\n*<a href='http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2012/05/120509-saturn-moon-titan-methane-organics-life-space-science/ ' target='_blank'>\"Is Saturn Moon's Haze Old Enough for Life?\"</a><br />\r\n*<a href='http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/news/cassiniscienceleague/science20091207/ ' target='_blank'>\"Methane on Titan and Enceladus: Nature vs. Nurture?\"</a></p>\r\n",

The more I researched the topic, the more I saw the immense value of the Space Program, not only to scientific discovery in general, but to day-to-day life on Earth. The paper I wrote in college was entitled \"Change of Heart.\" It placed in the paper competition, and I was fortunate enough to meet the NASA administrator, Dan Goldin, and secure an internship at NASA Stennis Space Center. My interest in space has only continued to intensify since that time.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>How did you end up working in the space program?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Although I have an engineering degree, my work experience had previously been on the business side of Project/Programs at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Kennedy Space Center, and NASA headquarters. I had been doing cost and schedule estimation, but I was looking for an opportunity to leverage my academic background. Europa Clipper Project Systems Engineering took a chance on me 2.5 years ago, something that changed my career trajectory completely. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Tell us about your job. What do you do?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><span>I'm the Project Systems Engineering Analysis Lead on Europa Clipper, responsible for developing and integrating complex mathematical models that provide system-level analyses to the Project. In other words, my team solves math problems, in order to set requirements, which tell other engineers how to build the spacecraft.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<div class='column-width image_module' style=''>\n<figure class='inline_figure'>\n<img alt='Clipper team at Mt Whitney' src='/internal_resources/727'>\n<figcaption>\nKelli with her Europa Clipper team members at Mt.

I had the opportunity to teach elementary students at SongAm Space Camp in South Korea during the summer of 2017 with several amazing colleagues. I realized I have a responsibility to share my knowledge and experiences with youth so that they know they, too, can work at NASA.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='column-width image_module' style=''>\n<figure class='inline_figure'>\n<img alt='Space camp in South Korea' src='/internal_resources/726'>\n<figcaption>\nTeaching elementary students at SongAm Space Camp in South Korea in 2017.\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\r\n\r\n<h3>What has been your biggest personal challenge, and how did you overcome it?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Soccer was my life growing up. I traveled around the world playing in high school, and then went on to receive a full Division 1 soccer scholarship. However, five knee surgeries later, I was forced into &ldquo;retirement&rdquo; just prior to my senior year of college. The identity crisis that followed was a learning experience for me, but I came out of it a stronger person with a new focus on academics.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Who inspires you?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Dolly Parton! She is a philanthropist, business woman, comedian, and obviously musically talented. I have read all her books, seen all her movies, and can sing all her songs.

Great things can happen.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What do you get up to in your free time?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Travel is a passion. I ran with the bulls in Spain, trekked with a troop of gorillas in Rwanda, worked with Mother Theresa&rsquo;s organization in Calcutta, and ran a marathon on the Great Wall of China. I also enjoy country line dancing, hiking, biking, and snowboarding.

I am now living in Pasadena, California.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Describe the first time you made a personal connection with outer space. </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Ever since I was a little kid, weather has been my main interest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a kid, I did have an interest in space and I did have my own telescope. However, I think the real defining and turning point for me in my space awareness was actually the Columbia disaster in 2003.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This tragic event took place when I was in 8th grade and at a University Interscholastic League academic competition through the University of Texas at Austin. The teachers brought everyone into the cafeteria and told us that the shuttle didn't make it home. I remember thinking to myself: <i>We have people in space? What are they doing there? Why didn't I know that?</i> So, I started reading more about space.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In July 2005, I saw STS-114 launch (the return flight after Columbia) and that made me really interested in human spaceflight. I went on to attend Space Camp in Huntsville, Alabama during the summers of 2006 and 2007.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All of these experiences combined really made me want to work in the space program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My first real exposure with planetary science and robotic space missions was actually at Space Camp when we watched the <i>Roving Mars</i> movie in the IMAX theatre. I was completely entranced by the whole movie. Everyone in the movie was so invested in the rovers and I gained immense respect for the rover team.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><blockquote>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin clearfix'></div>\n<div class='quote'>\n\"If you're like me and everything sounds interesting, then go and do those things.

It was difficult for me to reconcile my love of weather and my new-found love for space; that is until I was looking into schools in Texas and selecting my major.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Texas A&M seemed like a good fit for me since they have a good meteorology undergraduate program. I wore a NASA hoodie on one of my visits to A&M, and one of the professors there connected me with Dr. Mark Lemmon who studies the weather on Mars. That's when things clicked and I could combine my interests by studying the weather on other planets. It was the perfect combination of my two major interests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I worked with Dr. Lemmon for six years as I was completing my bachelor's and later my master's in meteorology. Dr. Lemmon also introduced me to and involved me in mission operations and data analysis. While a student, I worked on the Phoenix Mars Lander, the Mars Exploration Rovers (Spirit and Opportunity), and the Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity rover. I also worked with some Hubble data while working for Dr. Lucas Marci in the astronomy department at A&M.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Besides this, I was very much involved in the <i>Students for the Exploration and Development of Space</i> at A&M and was an officer for many years. Our group entered two NASA competitions related to developing ideas for the human spaceflight program. I really enjoyed the proposal process and getting to think outside the box. It was also an introduction to the engineering process for me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I started as an employee at NASA's <a href='http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/' target='_blank'>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</a> (JPL) in August 2013, and in that time frame I have met so many amazing people. Everyone has such varied backgrounds, yet we're all united in our passion for space exploration. My hope is that I too will have an amazing career at JPL.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The first inspiration was of course my parents, who never forced me to play with <i>girly</i> things and let me play with a microscope, and such, instead. They also put up with me either demanding to watch Disney movies or <i>The Weather Channel</i> for pretty much my entire childhood, so kudos to them for surviving that and letting me learn about the weather.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next would be my advisor from Texas A&M, Dr. Mark Lemmon. I simply wouldn't be where I am right now if he hadn't been my mentor. He gave me so many great opportunities while I was in school that led directly to my working for NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There's also a whole string of great teachers I've had along the way, but I won't attempt to name them because I know I'll forget one that should be mentioned. I'm fairly certain those teachers already know who they are anyway.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have met so many extraordinary women. I'm still surprised that most of my management and much of the science planners at JPL are women. It is certainly refreshing to be surrounded by so many amazing women, especially since it is common to hear about the lack of women in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is a science planner? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Science planning is a great job and is a hybrid between science and engineering. It also involves a lot of communication. I'm an extremely social person -- I like to talk to any- and everyone -- so this is a wonderful fit for my personality and my interests. Science planners take information from the science team regarding the type of science they would like to conduct and then develop the observations in order to obtain the science. Depending on the mission, the science planners also do a lot of the sequencing and writing the code that is sent to the spacecraft.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I worked on the Mars missions, science planning was a very quick and a constantly changing thing. Each day, we planned only one to three days in advance -- it can get quite crazy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Curiosity, I did science planning for the environment theme group, which focused on the atmosphere and the environment around the rover. I mostly used the cameras, but also planned for some of the other atmospheric themed instruments. Nowadays, I am working on the Dawn mission (a mission within the asteroid belt to dwarf Ceres) and the science planning process is essentially the same, but very stretched out. On this mission, we are planning for weeks at a time and months in advance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of my work on the Dawn mission is writing the instrument and science sequences that go to the spacecraft. The sequences operate the instruments and the spacecraft to be able to do the science observations. There's a lot involved in writing just that little bit of code. The sequences have to be written, then run by other programs, then also checked in our testbed. We have some computers and spare models of the instruments that we use to simulate Dawn, since it's a lot better to fix problems here on the ground than in space.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career. </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I think my favorite moment was when Phoenix successfully landed on Mars. It was exactly one year to the day from when I graduated high school, and yet there I was in the Science Operations Center at the University of Arizona. As the images came down from the spacecraft, I put them up onto the screens for the rest of the scientists to see. I couldn't believe that I was involved in space missions so early on in college.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Science planning is really mostly about communication. Learn to be clear and concise in speaking. Be careful with that words you use and the connotations behind them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To be a science planner, you need a technical background in either science or engineering. The specific field doesn't really matter. It can be anything from biology to meteorology to aerospace engineering. Some of the applicable skills found in these majors are learning how to research and understand a topic without having it taught to you, communicating technical topics, and being able to write code. The specific coding language isn't important, but the logic and mindset coding takes is important to develop. Once you know one language, it's very easy to learn others.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I spend a lot of time reading. It used to mostly be books, and now it's mostly articles online. I also like to play board games and spend time with friends. When I can, I like to go hiking and to the beach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I love spending time with my husband and cats Mindy and Misty, too. My husband and I also love dancing. We do everything from salsa, to swing, to contra dancing. We also took some lessons from the Aggie Wranglers, so we can do some acrobatic country moves too.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If you're like me and everything sounds interesting, then go and do those things. Take classes outside of your major, go on field expeditions, etc. That's how you'll learn more about what you like and what you don't like. One of the reasons I chose to minor in Earth science was because I had some interest in geology and also wanted to take planetary geology. I also took an oceanography class just because I was interested in it. I signed up for a geophysics field expedition on a whim and spent a few weeks in Wyoming deploying seismometers and getting geologic tours of that area of the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you hear of a professor at your school, or even elsewhere, that is doing work you're interested in, send them an email or stop by their office. I very rarely encounter someone who isn't interested in talking about his or her work. And who knows, maybe you can work with them on a project while still in school.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have the time, take as many dual credit or AP/IB classes in high school as possible. They can help free up your college time to pursue those different classes you're interested in.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><b>Read More: </b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>*<a href='http://dawn.jpl.nasa.gov' target='_blank'>NASA's Dawn Mission Site</a><br />\r\n*<a href='http://mars.nasa.gov' target='_blank'>NASA's Mars Site</a></p>\r\n",

So yes, I am a Green Bay Packer fan!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Describe the first time you made a connection with outer space.</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Since I was 10 years old, I knew I wanted to be an aerospace engineer. The movie <i>October Sky</i> and the story of Homer Hickam deeply inspired my life ambition. It was a defining moment in my life when the mindset of \"aerospace or bust\" was instilled in me. The ability to reach space and explore the unknown moved me, and I was captivated by Homer's devotion. His success while overcoming difficulties showed me I too could do it. I strove for merit in my academic life earning honor roll placements in middle school, high school and college. I found it crucial to continue with the Boy Scouts of America and achieve the rank of Eagle Scout. I knew building a foundation of academic honors and leadership experience would put me at an advantage as I pursued my ultimate goal of designing space vehicles.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin clearfix'></div>\n<div class='quote'>\n\"When you encounter difficulties or failures, do not take no for an answer.

I worked at Woodward, Inc. in Rockford, IL, over the course of four summers as an intern working on fuel controls for jet turbine engines until I finally earned an internship with NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA, in Fall 2012 after three years and 150+ applications. Feeling that actually working for NASA full-time was in reach, I knew I needed a bit more on my resume, so I then went on to Georgia Tech to obtain my Master's in Aerospace Engineering in May of 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In my final semester at Georgia Tech I flew out to California for the third round of interviews with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, known to many as just JPL, where they informed me after the interview that I did not possess the experience the particular position I interviewed for required. Being rejected did not stop me. I took a chance, a huge risk, and I graduated without a job and took a 10-week internship with NASA-JPL. My goal was to prove to them in 10 weeks that they could not survive without me. And I WAS SUCCESSFUL!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now I currently work as a Systems Engineer at JPL in Pasadena, CA, working in Project Formulation. I work in the Advanced Design Engineering group working on advanced mission concept studies. I also spend some of my free time engaging in public outreach where I write to students, present to children and give guided tours of NASA-JPL.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am also an Eagle Scout! My Eagle Scout project was building a 30-foot brick patio walkway to a 30-foot diameter brick patio with a fire pit in the center for a handicapped hunting facility known as Joe's Lodge in Black Creek, WI.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Homer Hickam Jr. -- Former NASA engineer and published author most famously known for <i>Rocket Boys</i>, which is the basis for the movie <i>October Sky</i>. If you have not seen the movie <i>October Sky</i> and read the book <i>Rocket Boys</i>, I HIGHLY recommend you do so!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What does your job entail?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I am a Systems Engineer on the Europa Lander team and also on Team X and Team Xc. For the Europa Lander I am on the Flight Systems Engineering team where we make sure that all elements of the design are covered and integrated properly. A large part of this particular job is making sure everyone is working with the same information and communication is occurring effectively. For Team X and Team Xc, which are both rapid design concurrent engineering teams, I am a Systems Engineer, integrating all the aspects of the design and managing the top level requirements like mass, power and cost. In these design studies, that are multiple three-hour sessions, I ensure that the design comes together and we create a feasible spacecraft at the end. Part of this process is ensuring the tools and models that everyone in the room is using are integrated and working correctly, as well as being informed on all aspects of the design so that when decisions come up of what design change to go with, I am able to make the right decisions that will ultimately impact the rest of the design.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='image_module right' style='width: Color image of Kevin&#39;s car.

I look forward to when my work returns to give us the answers that we did not initially have: when a lander lands, works and collects science to help us learn about bodies in the solar system; when a spacecraft is finally built and launched after years of design and seeing it on paper. To truly see the physical spacecraft at the end is going to be amazing.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Start early and stay dedicated. I knew what I wanted to do at a young age, so I made efforts to get myself into advanced classes to get ahead by taking summer courses to increase my knowledge. Make the sacrifices early so that you can enjoy them later; it's worth it if you think about the future! I also participated in community service via the Boy Scouts and other organizations to gain respect, good work ethic and connections in my community which help boost me to get scholarships. In high school, take as many STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) courses as possible, but also work in communications courses because being able to talk about and present your work effectively is crucial. For college I recommend taking either an engineering or a physics degree route and looking for schools that are currently working with NASA such as Georgia Tech, MIT and CalTech, just to name a few. I felt that I needed to go on to Georgia Tech because my undergraduate school of Platteville was small and did not have any workings or history with NASA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you encounter difficulties or failures, do not take no for an answer. If you truly want to accomplish something and are passionate about it, you need to believe in yourself, put your mind to it, and you can accomplish anything! I failed A LOT, but I NEVER GAVE UP. It took three years and over 150 applications to NASA before I received my first internship with NASA Langley in Virginia in 2012 (online applications, emails, letters in the mail). Georgia Tech denied my application to graduate school initially. After three weeks of communication with the Dean of Admissions, he created a spot for me and let me in. A week after that I received a Graduate Research Assistantship from reaching out to professors asking if I could have one, where they paid for my school and then PAID ME to do research. JPL interviewed me in my last semester in grad school and did not give me a full-time job. I graduated without a job and took a 10-week internship to prove to them I belong. Now I am a FULL-TIME NASA ENGINEER!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Give me an opportunity, I'll take it.<br />\r\nGive me a challenge, I'll beat it.<br />\r\nGive me an obstacle, I'll overcome it.<br />\r\nGive me the chance, I'll succeed.<br />\r\nChange The World!</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='center image_module' style=''>\n<figure class='inline_figure'>\n<img src='/images/content/1916825.jpg'>\n<figcaption>\nKevin knew he wanted to be an aerospace engineer at age 10.\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I am a certified personal trainer who enjoys all things health and fitness related. Whether I'm in the gym lifting weights, out in the mountains hiking, or on the beach surfing and relaxing, I'm always keeping fit and sharing my knowledge and experiences with others through my social media platforms and personal training website. When the time calls for it, after long days of work and exercise, I like to kick back and relax with some Netflix or go to see a movie, and fitting in some Oreos and Skittles now and then. :)</p>\r\n",

That's where I spent most of what I suppose were my \"formative years.\" But I was born in Upstate New York and lived in Cincinnati, Ohio, until I was 10.

Sometimes I'd go channel surfing to see what was out there. One day I happened upon NASA TV, which was showing just a live feed of Earth&mdash;no commentary or music, just silence and Earth. I was completely transfixed. I remember thinking how incredible it was that I could go to a channel on my TV and see Earth from the vantage point of space. It was the first time I really stopped to think about how amazing it was that mankind had invented ways to leave Earth and explore other planets&mdash;and at the same time, how much there was still to explore.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='image_module right' style='width: Web producer Kim Orr at NASA&#39;s Jet Propulsion Laboratorypx;'>\n<figure class='inline_figure'>\n<img alt='' src='/images/content/orr_319.png'>\n</figure>\n</div>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>How did you end up working in the space program?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I grew up loving science, especially biology and geology. Until my junior year of high school, I was pretty serious about wanting to become a veterinarian. I attended camps and workshops and had even picked out the colleges I wanted to apply to. But I realized that year, when I took a course in AP biology, that I liked learning about science more than doing it. So I switched career paths to my other passion: writing. After I graduated from Cal State Fullerton with a degree in journalism, I went to work as an editor for a business magazine, but set my sights on working for a magazine where I could combine my passions for science and writing. One day, I was combing job sites and saw a listing for \"Web Editor\" at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory. At that time, I had no idea there was a NASA center in Southern California. I'd just figured there was one NASA center in Florida, where they launched the space shuttles. It soon became clear that I'd stumbled on my dream job -- a job where I could do creative work at a place that's actually doing the science and exploration I'd always read about in those magazines.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My love of science, writing, editing and design come from my parents -- my mom, especially. Her background is in nursing, but she's written and edited a number of publications and has a strong creative side, too. Both my parents are fans of language and writing, so growing up those topics would always sneak into our dinner-table conversations.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is a Web Producer?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A web producer helps create the content you see on a website, whether it's articles, videos, graphics or games. Sometimes the web producer creates the content themselves or with a team, and sometimes, they hire other experts to produce the content for them. It requires a lot of creative thinking, planning and organizing, and the ability to understand different audiences and what they're looking for. I've been fortunate in that it's also allowed me to get practice and build up my skills in a number of creative areas beyond writing, including graphic design. It's a great job if, like me, you're interested in all kinds of creative expressions and finding ways to combine them in engaging ways to tell a good story.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><div class='image_module left' style='width: Kim Orr, web producer and Mars Curiosity modelpx;'>\n<figure class='inline_figure'>\n<img src='/images/content/curiouskim.jpg'>\n<figcaption>\nKim Orr poses in front of the Mars Curiosity Rover model with her \"<a href='http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/edu/learn/project/rover-view-3-d-mask/' target='_blank'>RoverView glasses</a>\" at NASA'S Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career.</b><br />\r\nI'd been at JPL for just few years when I got to experience my first landing -- and it was perhaps the most knuckle-biting yet. At the time, I was a web producer for the JPL news website and for weeks, we'd been releasing videos and articles about how risky -- and seemingly impossible -- the Mars Curiosity rover's landing would be. In addition to never being tried before, it required that the spacecraft perform every maneuver in its landing process perfectly -- <a href='https://youtu.be/Ki_Af_o9Q9s' target='_blank'>and each maneuver sounded crazier than the last</a>. The night of the landing, my team was tasked with posting Curiosity's first images from the ground once it was safe on Mars. I'm an optimistic person, but I was fully prepared to release contingency statements instead. Then, one by one, the mission team called off each successful maneuver: \"Parachute deployed... decelerating... powered flight... sky crane... touchdown confirmed. We're safe on Mars!\" The room erupted with applause. I took a minute to bask in the swell of pride I felt to work at JPL and be surrounded by such incredible, talented people. Then it was time get to work sharing that pride with the rest of the world through the first photos sent back from the rover that could.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><div class='center image_module' style=''>\n<figure class='inline_figure'>\n<img src='/images/content/kim_emu_835.png'>\n<figcaption>\nKim Orr in front of an emu mural at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County.\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give someone who wants to take the same career path as you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Never stop learning and being curious. So much of what I do is made possible by my curiosity and my passion for learning -- even when the subject is something I may not plan to become an expert in. And because the web and technology changes so fast, it's important to continually expand your knowledge and skills so you can adapt with the times. Along those same lines, I always recommend to young people who are interested in studying communications or visual communications to double-major in another subject. The skills you learn in communications will serve you well in any field -- and, as I found out, will open doors in some unexpected places. But you can really set yourself apart if you can combine your communications skills with your knowledge about and experience in a particular subject.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I'm sort of a hobbyist of hobbies because I'm always finding something new I want to try out. My consistent favorites are travel, food, arts and crafts, and outdoor sports like biking, surfing, rock climbing and hiking. I've been to more than 20 countries and most of my trips have involved some if not all of those hobbies.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give a student interested in science, technology, math or engineering (STEM)?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Get involved in STEM in any way you can, whether its participating in team competitions, visiting museums, attending star-gazing parties or even just exploring online, to learn about all the places STEM can take you. Since I've worked at JPL, I've discovered so many fascinating careers I never knew existed -- many that make me want to go back to school for a STEM degree just so I can do the amazing things these scientists and engineers are doing. Although, writing about them is pretty stellar, too.</p>\r\n",

Along that journey, my parents only encouraged me to work hard and even more so, to enjoy that work.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is a Systems Engineer?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A Systems Engineer can be hard to describe, especially on a smaller project, since they often expand to fill needs as they arise. As a Systems Engineer on Dawn, I create sequences to send to the spacecraft to perform activities, like playing back data in a special way or doing an engineering calibration. I review and test sequences on the testbed which has both hardware copies of components on the spacecraft as well as software simulations. The testbed is where we find any bugs before sending the final product to the spacecraft. With a current roundtrip light time of over an hour, there's no room for mistakes!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Systems Engineers also need to be problem solvers when the spacecraft exhibits any anomalous behavior. We monitor states on the spacecraft, like temperatures and counters, and take action if we see anything concerning. You need a good overall understanding of all of the spacecraft's subsystems (i.e. flight software, thermal, propulsion, attitude control, etc.) so that you can understand the complex interactions on the spacecraft.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>One of my absolute favorite moments was seeing the first full-frame Vesta image. There is something very unique about being in the first group of people to see an image of a previously unseen body. Seeing the detailed cratered surface was mind blowing.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Work hard. If you love what you do, it won't be difficult and it will definitely pay off in the end! Engineering is not the easiest major to undertake and does not lend itself to the most relaxed college experience, but in the end you will be doing what is in my opinion the coolest job on this planet and you will never be bored. Learn all that you can about the field. Stay current on new developments and activities in the space industry. Join any groups or clubs outside of class that give you more hands on experience in the field. Network and put yourself out there, meeting as many people in the field as you can. Learn how to explain yourself and communicate well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Explore the field. Join any groups outside of your classes that will give you hands on experience, like rocket or airplane building clubs. Attend lectures and presentations on subjects that you find interesting. Put yourself out there and meet as many people in the field as possible. Take classes on coding, even if it's not a requirement for your specific major. Trust me, it will come in handy! Stay current on new technologies and things happening in the space industry. Lastly, work hard! People recognize and appreciate hard work and will want you as part of their team.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='center image_module' style=''>\n<figure class='inline_figure'>\n<img src='/images/content/IMG_7372.jpg'>\n<figcaption>\nKristina enjoys rock climbing in her free time.\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I am always up for a good adventure. This has taken me skydiving, parasailing, and more. My current interest is rock climbing, both at the Stronghold climbing gym and outdoors around Southern California. I practice yoga to keep me injury and stress free, and I love to explore the awesome hikes that we have around LA. I also really enjoy reading.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I come from an arts background so music still plays a big role in my life and I play flute very often.

      "body": "<h3><b>Where are you from? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I was born in Norman, Okla., but our family moved a lot while I was growing up. We lived in the California Bay Area several times as well as in Iowa, Nebraska and Tennessee. Currently, I am living in Bonny Doon, Calif., in the Santa Cruz Mountains, just up the hill from Santa Cruz, Calif.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Describe the first time you made a personal connection with outer space. </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I remember one summer evening as a child lying on top of a picnic table watching the stars come out. They were beautiful, and then I saw a satellite go by and it was amazing to think we (humans) were not just here on Earth, but also in space.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But as a child, I spent most of my time exploring streams and lakes. There I would spend hours building temporary habitats for small fish and tadpoles, and seeing how the water flowed differently depending on the rocks and sediments. I was fascinated by all of it; the rocks themselves, the water, the plants (algae, mosses and ferns), how the sunlight sparkled through and off the surfaces, and also the animals. I don't think it was at that time that I realized there was also a connection between that little terrestrial geo-biosphere and what was in the sky; that came later and made it all even more amazing.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>How did you end up working in the space program? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In the late 1990s during the debate over the interpretation of features in the Allen Hills meteorite, it became clear that there was a great interest in expanding our knowledge of the limits of life (if it could be found elsewhere besides on the Earth) and to further our understanding of early and modern Earth. At that time, the advent of astrobiology created new opportunities at NASA for people such as myself in microbiology. In addition to basic ecological research, some of my first tasks were also to become familiar with and help facilitate the work of others in the area of planetary protection. All of these studies are important both to inform our exploration for life in space and to more fully understand the dynamic balances that now exist on the Earth, and how those have changed over the millennia.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I was inspired by my high school biology and chemistry teachers, and by my college ecology and geology professors. I was fortunate to have great teachers who promoted not just memorization of content, but inquisitiveness as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My parents were both key inspirations in my life. They would take me and my siblings to every interesting place they could find, wherever we lived. Whether it was whale watching, hiking in the desert, camping in new areas, going to museums, or trying new foods from other cultures, we always got out to view the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is a Microbial Ecologist? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I am someone who tries to figure out why a certain microbe is living in a particular place at a particular time. Many microbes cannot be cultivated -- however, sometimes they can be cultured if we do more detective work and figure out what they need and what they do in a specific environment. Even if we aren't successful, if we try to understand and hypothesize about a microbe, we can learn something important about the way it interacts with the environment or other microbes in its community.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There are so many! Early on I was doing a lot of work in rivers, estuaries, marshes and the open ocean. In doing this work I saw that many people were studying a cyanobacterium (Trichodesmium), which they could only find at sea. It took awhile, but I figured out how to grow it in the lab, and people still study it today, which is very cool. Another was helping to understand that cyanobacteria and associated microbes tunnel into carbonate grains in the Bahamas and change the way those carbonates are crystallized. It solved a big riddle, so that was fun! More recently, working at the Mars analog sites in the Andes has been fantastic. It's in many ways a harsh environment, with bitter cold temperatures, high ultraviolet light and little rain, but ... nonetheless there was a fantastic diversity of life, including many species we hadn't seen before. This will have us asking questions for some time to come!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Have fun! Get a good solid background in the basics, (chemistry, math, physics) and then just go where you are interested and expand your experience in those areas. And always try different things, and be open to an evolution of your interests. Internships and short-term jobs are great ways to learn, and they can help you discover something new and maybe change your direction or perspective on what you've done so far. I did not end up doing what I originally thought I'd do, but I'm very happy with all of the steps that I took.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My husband, daughter and I get outside as often as we can. Our favorite activities include taking our dogs to the beach, playing beach volleyball, biking, and hiking or camping. Growing up, my family always had a garden wherever we lived and that tradition continues with us. We have three gardens (vegetables and flowers) at our house, and I also get vegetables and garden at another spot at our community supported agriculture (CSA) farm. I also try to find time for reading, art projects, and yoga or dance as often as I can fit them in.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Again, it's really important to have a good solid basis, so cover your fundamentals, because that will make life easier later! Take breaks though and just casually learn about specific applications. Look into some that you think you are interested in going into, but also check out some that are kind of on the fringe of your interest; that will help keep you inspired to get through the basics and on to the good stuff!</p>\r\n",

To read the full original interview click <a href='http://womeninplanetaryscience.wordpress.com/2010/09/02/louise-prockter-be-tenacious/' target='_blank'>here</a></i></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Where are you from?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I am from the United Kingdom and grew up in London. I moved to the north of England for my undergraduate degree, and then to the U.S. for graduate school. I currently live in Washington D.C., which I love.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Describe the first time you made a personal connection with outer space. </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My family didn't have a huge amount of money when I was growing up, so we would spend our weekends doing things like visiting art galleries and museums in London, which were free. Our favorites were the Natural History Museum and the Science Museum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although I grew up in the city, both my parents were big nature lovers. We went on a lot of nature walks in and around London, and our holidays were spent camping. So, from a very young age, my siblings and I had a sense of wonder about the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the places we visited regularly was Stiffkey Marsh, a beautiful salt marsh along the Norfolk coast, about 120 miles north of London. This rural coast is not built up and at night the sky is spectacular, with the Milky Way clearly visible. My parents would point out the constellations to us, and I soon learned to find Orion, Cassiopeia, the Pleiades, and how to locate the North Star using the Plough (or as it is called in the U.S., the Big Dipper).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><blockquote>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin clearfix'></div>\n<div class='quote'>\n\"Be tenacious. If you know you </span><span>want to do something, go and find </span><span>someone who will help you do it.\"\n</div>\n<footer>\n<cite>- Louise Prockter</cite>\n</footer>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin'></div>\n</blockquote></span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>How did you end up working in the space program? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I actually had an early career in sales and marketing, and then went back to school for environmental science and geophysics at age 27. It wasn't until my final year at Lancaster University that I took two classes in planetary science. It was at that moment that I had the \"ah-ha!\" moment -- planetary science was what I wanted to do with my life. I had already decided I wanted to pursue a Ph.D., and my advisors in the U.K. (Lionel Wilson and John Shepherd) suggested I apply to programs in the U.S., since there are many more opportunities in planetary science over here. That is how I ended up in the planetary geology department at Brown University, initially studying volcanoes on Venus and comparing them to terrestrial mid-ocean ridge volcanoes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During my second year, while finishing my master's degree at Brown, I was trying to decide in which direction I wanted to go. At this time, the Galileo spacecraft had just gone into orbit around Jupiter and was starting to send back data from Ganymede. My colleagues, Bob Pappalardo and Geoff Collins, were looking at Ganymede's grooved terrain and trying to understand how it had formed. However, in addition to the grooved terrain images, there were many images of dark terrain on Ganymede. No one was looking at these images because they were generally considered to be less interesting than those of the grooved terrain. I asked my advisor Jim Head, one of the co-investigators on the mission, if I could look at these cratered dark areas on Ganymede. He said \"yes,\" and I started mapping out just one little area of dark terrain. I became completely absorbed in this dark terrain and this study turned into my very first science paper.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although I wasn't officially on the Galileo team (I was just one of the many graduate students working on the mission), I was allowed to go to team meetings. By attending these meetings I was able to meet a lot of people with whom I still work today. (Many of us met on the project as graduate students and we all sort of progressed in the profession together.) It was incredibly exciting and I realized that I wanted to spend the rest of my career involved in missions.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGalileo was such a challenging mission, with the antenna failure and problems with the limitations of the tape recorder. We \"cut our teeth\" on having such limited resources: We had to squeeze every last drop of science out of every little bit of data -- literally -- that came down. The Galileo mission was incredibly good training for me. We all really learned to be flexible on that mission. That was also where I learned that space exploration is sometimes hard and things can go wrong.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Had I not had the opportunity to work on the Galileo mission, I probably wouldn't have been as attractive as a new hire when I applied to work at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) -- I would have been like any other graduate student with a planetary geology degree.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My first position at APL was as a postdoc on the NEAR mission. The spacecraft should have gone into orbit around the asteroid Eros in February 1999, but due to technical issues, the orbit insertion was delayed for a year. This was perfect timing for me, because it meant that I arrived at APL just a couple of months before NEAR's encounter with Eros, and therefore I was able to be involved as an imaging team associate throughout the mission. My job was to look at the hundreds of images that came down from the spacecraft each day, and then verify their quality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the NEAR mission concluded in 2001, I started working as deputy to the instrument scientist (Scott Murchie) of the MESSENGER camera: the Mercury Dual Imaging System (MDIS). When Scott became principal investigator of the CRISM instrument on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO), I took over as the instrument scientist on the camera, in 2003. I learned a lot more about hardware, calibration, optical design, focal planes, you name it, than I had ever expected to from that position. I have worked on the MESSENGER mission ever since.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It's hard to pick any one person who inspired me as there have been many. Both my parents worked hard, but my mum was always pretty amazing in that she had a demanding, high-level teaching job and yet still did all the work involved in bringing up three kids. I think I realized early on that roles for women were changing (this was in the 1970s), and that although my mum still had the traditional \"mum\" role, she had a career as well. From this, I knew that I could have a career doing pretty much whatever I wanted if I was willing to work for it.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is a Planetary Group Supervisor? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I actually have three official jobs:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am a deputy project scientist and co-investigator on the MESSENGER mission. This means that I help with things like preparing science reports for NASA, extended mission proposals and so on, and I also get to do scientific analysis when I can find the time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the last three years I have also been the deputy study scientist for an ongoing NASA concept study to investigate a mission to Jupiter's moon Europa. (I recently took over as the chair of the Science Definition Team (SDT) for that same study. The SDT works with the study's technical team to define the science that would be done by a Europa mission, making scientific trades and scoping out instruments, orbital operation plans and so on.) This mission was given a very high priority in both of the last two Planetary Decadal Surveys and we hope that some funding will be found for it at some point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My third and final job (and official APL title) is that I supervise the Planetary Exploration Group at APL. This means that I manage about 30 planetary scientists, helping to make sure that they have enough funding and everything they need in order to produce fantastic science. I also make sure that our flight projects and instruments are fully staffed with the right people. I consider myself extremely lucky to work with such talented and interesting people. My job involves a lot of long hours and travel, but it is never boring.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career. </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It's hard to pick just one, but some highlights include: going to the bottom of the ocean in the submersible Alvin; seeing my first paper in print, which made me feel like a \"real\" scientist for the first time; the excitement I felt when APL called to offer me a postdoc position (this was a job I wanted more than anything); going to Barrow, Alaska for a fantastic Europa workshop run by the late, great Ron Greeley; and seeing the first stunning image of the previously unseen hemisphere of Mercury on MESSENGER's first flyby of the innermost planet -- I was so thrilled that the image was perfect, and so relieved that it was exactly in the center of the field of view, as we had planned it!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Be tenacious. If you know you want to do something, go and find someone who will help you do it. I have benefited from having some amazing mentors who introduced me to influential people and encouraged me to publish and present papers at conferences. If the person you're working with isn't helping you along the path you want to be on, then go and find someone else who will. And don't be afraid to try and don't give up -- be annoying until you get what you want.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You don't have to be a professor to be successful. There are many job opportunities in this field, especially for people with advanced degrees. We need good policy people. We need people who can help promote the importance of science and research to lawmakers. We need people at NASA Headquarters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To work on missions, it really helps to be somewhere where there's someone doing mission work. You can now be a student and also work on a mission, which generally was not the case in the past, but now there are a lot of opportunities with such programs as the Mars Exploration Program and Discovery.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I study and teach yoga.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Go for it! These are all areas from which you can go into a lot of different directions and can do something significant in the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><b>Read More:</b><br />\r\n*<a href=' http://womeninplanetaryscience.wordpress.com/2010/09/02/louise-prockter-be-tenacious/' target='_blank'>Post on Louise on the Women in Planetary Science Website</a><br />\r\n*<a href='http://messenger.jhuapl.edu/who_we_are/science_team.html' target='_blank'>Messenger Science Team Page</a><br />\r\n*<a href='https://opfm.jpl.nasa.gov/europajupitersystemmissionejsm/' target='_blank'>Europa Jupiter System Mission (EJSM) Page</a><br />\r\n*<a href='https://astrobiology.nasa.gov/directory/people/prockter-louise/' target='_blank'>NASA Astrobiology Page on Louise</a><br />\r\n*<a href=' http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v435/n7043/full/435749a.html ' target='_blank'>\"Shades of Titan\" Article by Louise Prockter in Nature</a></p>\r\n",

It didn't make any noise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next morning I told my parents about it and how I wanted to go look for the fireball that I thought must have landed in our neighborhood. They smiled, chuckled light-heartedly and explained that it may have looked close to us, but in fact there was a lot of empty space between our house and it -- it was probably very far away. There was something in this experience that gave me a sense of space beyond my neighborhood at the time. My parents didn't even go into the fact that the material in fireballs most often disintegrates completely due to the friction of the piece of rocky material traveling at high speed through the Earth's atmosphere.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><blockquote>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin clearfix'></div>\n<div class='quote'>\n\"Be sure to read to stimulate your imagination and write too, so you can share the excitement of the world around you to others.\"\n</div>\n<footer>\n<cite>- Lucy McFadden</cite>\n</footer>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin'></div>\n</blockquote></span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>How did you end up working in the space program?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There was no plan to do so -- it just happened. As a freshman in college, I had to list 10 courses I wanted to take during the year and I was to be assigned three. I selected \"Optical and Radio Astronomy\" because I couldn't understand what a radio had to do with astronomy. I got the class -- I guess my curiosity got the best of me. I also had an internship opportunity as an undergraduate at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) counting craters and measuring their diameter using data from Mariner 10's mission to Mercury.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As a young person, my sisters nurtured my interest in math and science, while I competed with my brothers to keep up with them. We used to do math problems at night for fun. My parents were interested in my academic success and asked about my day at school every night at the dinner table. My teachers provided me with opportunities to explore the scientific world on my own.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is a Co-Investigator?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A co-investigator is a member of the team of scientists who define the goals and objectives of a scientific mission. After we define the scientific questions, we work with engineers to determine how best to answer those questions. I work with the team to define the requirements of the mission and the instruments so that the engineers can build the spacecraft and instruments that will return the data that will answer questions about the nature of and formation of the solar system. The science team later works together to analyze the data we receive back from the spacecraft. We then publish the results.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career.</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My favorite moment is connected with the Deep Impact mission. On July 4, 2005, the Deep Impact spacecraft was intentionally sent on a collision course with comet Tempel 1. At the time, comet Tempel 1 was seven light-minutes from Earth. We received notice that there wasn't a signal from the spacecraft, while another one flew past the comet sending images of the impact back to Earth. We were in the room waiting and all of a sudden the image appeared on a large wall screen and we saw the ejecta from the impact lit up by the sunlight. It was an awesome experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now I am watching the Dawn spacecraft take images of asteroid 4 Vesta as it approaches and goes into orbit. Watching Vesta emerge from its distant shroud through the eyes of the Dawn spacecraft is an amazing experience too.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Be sure to read to stimulate your imagination, and write too, so you can share the excitement of the world that you discover to others. If you can make friends with mathematics, and are curious about the world, I think you're all set for a rewarding life in the scientific world.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Hike, run, cook, write and work. I also married and raised two daughters -- that was a lot of fun.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are curious, love the natural world and enjoy math and science, you can fall in love with space science.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><b>Read More</b></p>\r\n\r\n<a href='http://deepimpact.umd.edu/' target='_blank'>Deep Impact's Mission Page</a>\r\n\r\n<a href='http://dawn.jpl.nasa.gov' target='_blank'>Dawn's Mission Page</a>\r\n\r\n<a href='http://discovery.nasa.gov/near.cfml' target='_blank'>NEAR Shoemaker's Mission Page</a>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Links to Videos, stories, etc.</b></p>\r\n\r\n<a href=' http://deepimpact.umd.edu/mission/bios/bio-lmcfadden.html|Deep Impact Mission Biography' target='_blank'></a>\r\n\r\n<a href='http://womeninplanetaryscience.wordpress.com/2010/04/09/women-in-planetary-science-meet-lucy-mcfadden/' target='_blank'>Woman in Planetary Science Post on Lucy McFadden</a>\r\n\r\n<a href='http://www.planetary.org/radio/show/00000416/' target='_blank'>Planetary Society Radio Interview with Lucy McFadden</a>\r\n\r\n<a href='http://dawn.jpl.nasa.gov/feature_stories/antarctica.asp' target='_blank'>Article: \"A Dream Come True\"</a>\r\n",

      "body": "<h3><b>Where are you from? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I am originally from Greensboro, North Carolina.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Describe the first time you made a personal connection with outer space. </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I never really thought much about space science until I took an Earth-science course during my junior year of high school. One of the units we covered was astronomy. (I remember learning about the <a href='http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l2/stars.html' target='_blank'>H-R diagram</a> and the lifecycles of stars.) My teacher was great and always very enthusiastic about what he taught us: deaths of very massive stars, and the creation of gigantic black holes and how they consume everything in their paths. After that lecture, I was pretty much hooked on space.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin clearfix'></div>\n<div class='quote'>\n\"My second favorite moment has to be pouring over mosaics of Europa and learning to identify and map chaos regions, impact craters and other surface units...I felt that there was a whole other alien world at my fingertips.\"\n</div>\n<footer>\n<cite>- Lynnae Quick</cite>\n</footer>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin'></div>\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>How did you end up working in the space program? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Although my Earth-science class in high school influenced my interest in astrophysics, it was my high school physics teacher who suggested that it would be best for me to obtain a bachelor's degree in physics and then go on to graduate school for a Ph.D. in astronomy or astrophysics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After high school, I attended North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University (A&T) with a major in physics. While there, I was encouraged to apply to the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program during the summer. Through REU, I interned for the National Radio Astronomy Observatory. I also interned through the NASA Academy Program at NASA's Goddard Spaceflight Center (GSFC). I enjoyed both experiences and eventually returned to GSFC during my first two years of graduate school to conduct research in the Exoplanets and Stellar Astrophysics Lab.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While at GSFC, I became more and more interested in the characterization of exoplanets. At the time, there were all sorts of interesting theories about ocean planets: theorized exoplanets made mostly of water and/or ice. I decided that I would study more about ocean worlds in our own solar system in order to become more adept at characterizing ocean exoplanets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I then applied for a summer internship at the <a href='http://www.jhuapl.edu/' target='_blank'>Applied Physics Laboratory</a> (APL) and spent about three months there learning about Jupiter's moon Europa. I became fascinated with this icy world (and with planetary science in general), so much that I changed my course of study to focus on planetary geophysics in the Earth and Planetary Sciences Department at Johns Hopkins University. I was able to continue the Europa research I'd already started at APL and also combine it with the knowledge of terrestrial volcanic processes gleaned from my advisor at Hopkins in order to conduct thesis research on cryovolcanic and cryomagmatic processes on icy satellites. During my last year of graduate study at Hopkins, I was awarded a NASA Postdoctoral Fellowship to study volcanic processes on Venus at GSFC.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is a Planetary Geophysicist? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A planetary geophysicist is someone who investigates processes that occur on the solid bodies in our Solar System, often using mathematical models to simulate conditions on these worlds. With these models we study the internal structures of rocky and icy bodies. We also study volcanic processes, tectonics, impact cratering, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am really excited about the work I do because it allows me to apply what we know about the rocky bodies in our solar system to the icy satellites of the giant planets. For instance, it's so exciting to study volcanism on Earth and Venus, and then compare it to volcanic processes on bodies such as Enceladus, Triton and Europa where lavas could be aqueous solutions of water, salts and volatiles instead of the molten rock that we're used to dealing with on the terrestrial planets.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career. </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, my career has really just begun, but I do have a few favorite moments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I spent the summer after graduating from A&T studying Mars' remnant magnetic field in the Planetary Magnetospheres Lab at GSFC. My advisor, Mario Acu&ntilde;a, showed me how to bring up Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) images of the Martian surface on my computer. This was the first time I'd ever laid eyes, firsthand, on images of another planet's surface returned from a spacecraft. I remember just being in awe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My second favorite moment has to be pouring over mosaics of Europa and learning to identify and map chaos regions, impact craters and other surface units during my first summer at APL. Once again, I felt that there was a whole other alien world at my fingertips.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>NASA Astrophysicist Dr. Beth Brown was one of my biggest inspirations. I met her at an American Astronomical Society (AAS) conference my senior year in college. She was such a great role model and mentor to me. In fact, she was the one who encouraged me to apply for the internship studying Europa at APL.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since then, I've really been inspired by Dr. Louise Prockter. I started working with Dr. Prockter my first summer at APL and continued working with her while pursuing my Ph.D. at Johns Hopkins. Dr. Prockter is a great scientist -- she really took me under her wing and has also served as a great mentor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During my undergraduate years, I just felt so inspired by being able to obtain my undergraduate degree in the same physics program that NASA astronaut Dr. Ronald McNair obtained his.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I must also mention my physics teacher at Dudley High, Mr. John Brown, who was the first person to really encourage me to seek a career path in the space sciences. He set in my mind early on that it was absolutely possible for me to succeed in a field where there aren't many women or minorities. Having that type of \"You can do it\" encouragement at an early age goes a long way.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Be bold. Search out people who work in your area of interest. I gained a lot of opportunities by just emailing folks that I thought did cool research and inquiring if I could be their summer intern.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, becoming a professional scientist requires, above all else, a willingness to persevere. It will require you to take upper level science and math classes in high school and college that others generally try to shy away from; but if you can keep in mind that the end goal is being able to have a job where you do something that you really love every day, you'll get through it and probably also enjoy the journey. If possible, find a mentor either at your home institution or elsewhere that can encourage you, give you good advice and help you chart out the path that's best for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I love to read and I love to write about non-science things -- hence my love for creative writing. I began taking ballet as a stress-reliever during my last year and a half of grad school -- I've really begun to enjoy it. I also like to catch a good movie and just hang out with friends and family.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This probably sounds clich&eacute;, but take as many math and science courses as you can -- it's important to have that foundation. Math will give you the tools needed to investigate the most interesting phenomena in our solar system -- and beyond. Science courses, especially physics, give you experience in looking at the total problem, so to speak. They also teach you how to apply your math skills to the <i>big picture.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>While you're learning science and math, also embrace your humanities courses. Some of the most successful scientists I know are experts when it comes to being able to effectively communicate their ideas and results to non-scientists. There's no better way to improve your communication skills than taking courses that force you to read and write on a regular basis. To that end, because being a theorist requires, to some degree, being able to think outside the box, classes such as creative writing can be really helpful in honing original thinking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of all, I would say really spend some time finding out what areas of science or engineering interest you the most and what you really like to do. Read articles to learn about new innovations and groundbreaking research in the STEM fields. Also, look for opportunities such as internships where you can get hands-on experience working in an area that interests you.</p>\r\n",

Since 1987, when I left Rhode Island, I have called the San Francisco Bay Area home. (OK, I <i>was</i> born in New York City, but I think I have lost most of the accent.)</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin clearfix'></div>\n<div class='quote'>\nScientific curiosity should be like an itch&mdash;you can't sleep at night until you find the right answer.\n</div>\n<footer>\n<cite>- photo of Lynn Rothschild</cite>\n</footer>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin'></div>\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Describe the first time you made a personal connection with outer space. </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I looked up at the stars, as everyone does. However, I first developed a real fascination for the space program during the Apollo missions leading to the incredible events of the manned Moon landings. (We called it \"manned\" in those days, but today we call it \"human space exploration.\")</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In particular I remember being fascinated by Apollo 8, the first manned craft to orbit the moon, and of course Apollo 11 when the first humans set foot on another body in space. I was 12, and at a summer camp in Maine (Arcadia) when the moon landing took place. This camp, for the most part, didn't have electricity and certainly not a television. However, I knew the director had a television away from the campers, and so I started a campaign to somehow stay up and see the televised landing. The very enlightened director, who had a love for the stars and must have also shared my excitement, at the last minute decided it was so important that the entire camp of well over 100 girls should get up in the middle of the night and hike with flashlights to where there was one small, black and white television. By 2:00 in the morning the director and I were the only ones left in the room, still transfixed by the enormity of the event. Since that historic night I have met both of these Apollo 11 superstars -- Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin -- and I still stand in awe of their achievements. The danger of this landing was brought home to me a few years ago after seeing the draft of speeches that President Nixon had prepared to give if the astronauts had to be abandoned to perish on the moon.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>How did you end up working in the space program? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, if you had asked me when I was a biology major in college, or even a Ph.D. student in molecular biology, I would never have imagined that I would work in the space program. That changed when I gave a seminar on my Ph.D. thesis work about chloroplast evolution at Harvard and learned from Andy Knoll that NASA had a long-standing interest in early evolution. After all, how can we understand the evolution of life in the universe, or discover whether we are alone in the cosmos, without a deep understanding of the one place we have data -- planet Earth. Within a year I had an application in hand for a fellowship at NASA, which was followed by a call from NASA in the middle of winter asking me if I wanted to look for life on Mars, go to the Antarctic and move to California. Well, what would you say?</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Some kids are motivated to go into science because of a scientist or teacher who inspires them, and perhaps someone will be inspired by this interview. I have been extremely fortunate in having had a series of excellent mentors at nearly all stages in my career. When I was young, my father, grandfathers and two terrific teachers encouraged me in science. As I mature, I realize how important it is to thank them, as they gave so much of themselves to help me achieve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Science is so incredibly compelling that in my case I was also inspired by protists -- unicellular eukaryotes such as paramecia. They grabbed my interest and have never let go. And Charles Darwin always inspires me.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is an astrobiologist? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The field focuses on three of humankind's most fundamental questions: <i>Where do we come from?</i>, <i>Where are we going?</i> and <i>Are we alone?</i> Thus, an astrobiologist tackles one or more of these questions. Because all of these are so multidisciplinary, astrobiologists start out in one of more of the traditional science disciplines -- biology, geology, chemistry and astronomy. The field of astrobiology also includes engineers and some social scientists, who look at the ethical implications of astrobiology.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career. </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A nice, quiet afternoon behind a microscope with a cool field sample is my idea of relaxation. Elation comes from fresh data -- whether it confirms your original hypothesis or not -- as long as it is clear. Also, the moments when, suddenly, doors are opened to you, such as being asked for advice by the NASA administrator, being promoted by your center director, having an offer to fly an experiment to 100,000 feet on a balloon -- or 400,000 feet on a rocket -- spending the night in Windsor Castle, being filmed for television, or speaking at the Vatican Observatory -- how can you beat these for career excitement? After all, scientists are human too.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Be passionate about what you do. Scientific curiosity should be like an itch -- you can't sleep at night until you find the right answer or at least the next step. Read and study broadly, which is very easy to do in this era of the Internet. Ask interesting questions, pursue them and find mentors who will guide you.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Music. Right now we are doing some serious bagpiping in our family (but my son will always be better than me). I also enjoy swimming, canoeing, photography and traveling (although much of it is job related).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In any of the fields, learn the most you can. Learn to be critical of the data, including when results should be challenged and when they should be accepted. With the Internet, talk radio and blogging, one must understand that not all information or opinions are of equal quality. If you are interested in becoming an astrobiologist in particular, at a minimum take evolutionary biology, microbiology or other biodiversity courses, molecular and cell biology, biochemistry, earth science, astronomy and planetary science.</p>\r\n",

For a young girl from a small town in a largely underserved area, getting to NASA was pretty much unheard of in those parts of the country. The story is, of course, much deeper - one that I've told in a TEDx talk called the Power of One. It is a story of how just one person has the power to steer the course of a young student's life. I had three teachers who did just that and I credit for putting me where I am today, together with my family and professional mentors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><figure class='column-width embedded_video video_player_container'>\n<div class='video_wrapper'>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/iQDvm9ru-pw?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n<figcaption>\nWatch Mamta's TEDx talk.\n</figcaption>\n</figure></span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What missions have you worked on?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<div class='image_module left' style=''>\n<figure class='inline_figure'>\n<img alt='Color image of Mamta in a TV studio.' src='/internal_resources/574'>\n<figcaption>\nOn an interview set at NASA to tell my story to be a role model to other young students.\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>I have worked in human spaceflight for both the Space Shuttle and International Space Station with training astronauts and operations engineering in the Mission Control Center.

But, I will forever more always point to the two people who came from nothing and gave me everything: my parents. From a tough life in impoverished conditions in a rural area of India to a tough life in a small West Texas town where ignorance of other cultures prevailed, my parents were part of an immigrant generation that at the time was still proving themselves capable of creating a highly educated and contributing next generation of Americans (to which I am proud to say I belong).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><div class='center image_module' style=''>\n<figure class='inline_figure'>\n<img alt='FILE:FullSizeRender.jpg' src='/images/content/Mamta_Family_835.jpg'>\n<figcaption>\nMy sweet family - the support and love it takes to balance work and life.\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What does your job entail?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, I get to communicate science - the awe-inspiring science that delves into the universe in a quest to know the unknown.

After four years there, I moved to Boulder, Colorado for my graduate work.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Describe the first time you made a personal connection with outer space.</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>One evening, when I was four years old, I was outside with my parents, and I saw a meteor. Already a logical youngster, I concluded it was a witch streaking across the sky, and I was terrified -- I was quite afraid of witches at that age. When my parents told me that it was something from space burning up in the atmosphere, I was captivated -- I have been fascinated with space and science ever since.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin clearfix'></div>\n<div class='quote'>\n\"My interest in space and science only grew stronger as I grew older, and I followed all aspects of space exploration as closely as I could while pursuing my education.\"\n</div>\n<footer>\n<cite>- Marc Rayman</cite>\n</footer>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin'></div>\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>How did you end up working in the space program?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>For as long as I can remember, I have wanted to work for NASA -- really the only organization I ever dreamed of working for. I actually began writing to NASA's <a href='http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/' target='_blank'>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</a> (JPL) and other NASA facilities, as well as other space agencies and scientific institutions around the world, when I was only nine years old. I received many nice responses over the years, including answers to my many questions, as well as brochures, articles, pictures, posters, and other items. I have accumulated quite a collection of information and memorabilia from the exploration of space. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>My interest in space and science only grew stronger as I grew older, and I followed all aspects of space exploration as closely as I could while pursuing my education. My aspiration of being a part of NASA never wavered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After I earned my Ph.D. in physics at the Joint Institute for Laboratory Astrophysics in Boulder, NASA was still the only place I wanted to work. I continued as a postdoctoral researcher, and I applied to several NASA centers. I was thrilled to accept one of the offers I had from JPL, and I have been here ever since.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I have been inspired by a great many scientists throughout history -- mostly physicists and astronomers, as well as scientists in other fields. I love learning about their work and their creativity, diligence and persistence. There are far too many to name all that have inspired me, but if I had to choose just one I would pick the brilliant Paul Dirac. Among his extraordinary accomplishments was predicting the existence of antimatter in 1928. It was discovered only four years later by Carl Anderson. The power of science itself inspires me!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have also been energized by the people in the US and elsewhere who accomplished human and robotic space missions from the very beginning of space exploration. These missions enthralled me when I was younger: I only knew the names of a few individuals who were a part of these wonderful missions, but I was also well aware that it took a great many talented and dedicated men and women to achieve such marvelous feats.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is a mission manager or chief engineer? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I am fortunate enough to be involved in all the technical aspects of the operation of the Dawn mission to dwarf planet Ceres. I get to marvel at the big picture and to delve into the fascinating details. In brief, I am responsible for ensuring all the different pieces of this complex undertaking fit together so we can accomplish ambitious scientific objectives.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career. </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Working for NASA has been like a dream come true for me, and there have been many wonderful moments and experiences I will treasure for the rest of my life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One outstanding memory occurred on 22 September 2001 and involves the Deep Space 1 mission.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I started working on DS1 in 1995, when a few colleagues and I developed the initial concept for the mission. Its objective was to test ion propulsion (which I first heard of on <i>Star Trek</i>), artificial intelligence and other exotic technologies on an operational interplanetary mission so that they could be used on subsequent missions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We launched DS1 in 1998, and completed its very productive primary mission in 1999. However, we still had a healthy, capable spacecraft out there in the solar system. So, NASA Headquarters approved an <i>extended mission</i> devoted to exploring a comet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shortly thereafter, a component we had considered absolutely indispensable failed. By all rights that should have been fatal for the spacecraft, and the mission should have ended and rested on its laurels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the best spirit of NASA's remarkable history of overcoming the most daunting challenges, my team and I accomplished one of the most ambitious deep space rescue missions ever attempted. It was a very, very difficult seven months, but by June of 2000 the ship was sailing smoothly enough to resume its pursuit of the comet. We used the ion propulsion system and some of the other advanced technologies to guide this aged and wounded bird to a spectacular encounter with comet Borrelly 11 days after 9/11. While the world's attention was focused elsewhere, the spacecraft performed its daring mission flawlessly. DS1 provided NASA with its first close-up views and other precious data from a comet, exceeding our wildest hopes for success.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I'm usually pretty articulate, but it seemed that all I could say for several hours after the best picture came up on our screens in mission control was \"I just can't believe how incredibly cool this is.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Everyone's career path is going to be different, because everyone is different and everyone's circumstances are different. So the first advice I would offer is to do the best you can with your own abilities and limitations, as well as your own opportunities and constraints. Forge your own course in life. Build on your strengths, and don't wait for someone else to give you a lucky break. Make your own luck -- work hard and take responsibility for your own success.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI'm sure everyone knows all the standard advice about doing well in school, and it's both valid and important, but I don't have anything new to say about that.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My job is fun. After all, my favorite hobby for my whole life has been learning about space exploration and the many branches of science. (Many fields interest me. A few of them are particle physics, cosmology and evolutionary biology.) I'm very fortunate that I get to make my living doing what I love so much. I do devote a great deal of my personal time to it as well. I also like to share the rewards of science and the excitement and the wonder of interplanetary adventures by giving public presentations and writing a blog, which provides an inside view of a real deep-space mission (see link further below).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBeside this, I also greatly enjoy international folk dancing, nature photography (especially insects and flowers), hiking, and other outdoor activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are interested in a field, pursue it. You get as much out of life as you put into it. So if you really enjoy a topic, indulge yourself, fuel your passions, work hard, and don't forget to recognize how fortunate you are to be engaged in something so gratifying. One reason I find my work so rewarding is that I take the time to step back and appreciate what a marvelous adventure I am involved in.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe live in a culture that, to a large extent, does not understand what science is or how it works. So in addition to your technical work, if you have or can develop the needed skills, help the public understand science. Everyone will benefit if you can convey your knowledge to a broader audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I knew from the time I was in elementary school that I wanted to get a Ph.D. in physics. I loved every physics and math class I took in school, but I also considered it important to get a broad education. So when I was an undergraduate, I took many courses in different subjects in the humanities as well. I think there is great value in breadth as well as depth.</p>\r\n",

I was lucky that the night sky where I lived was absolutely glorious, due to the fact that my hometown was relatively small and light pollution was not an issue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was also lucky that my mom knew quite a few things about astronomy (although she is not a scientist). She would explain to me some basics about the stars, the Milky Way, the vast distances of space, even a bit on the ultimate destiny of our Sun. From that moment on, I was hooked on anything space-related.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I even made my parents take me to join the local amateur astronomers club when I started elementary school. Unfortunately, I was told that there were no astronomy programs for a 7-year old and that I should come back when I was a bit older (which I did).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><blockquote>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin clearfix'></div>\n<div class='quote'>\nI was told that there were no </span><span>astronomy programs for a 7-year </span><span>old and that I should come back </span><span>when I was a bit older (which I did).\n</div>\n<footer>\n<cite>- Marina Brozovic</cite>\n</footer>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin'></div>\n</blockquote></span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>How did you end up working in the space program? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It was not a straightforward path for me, because obviously, my starting point (a small country in southeastern Europe) did not have anything that even remotely resembled a space program. I cannot even say that I hoped or planned that I would be working for NASA someday (although my dad always jokingly said that nothing short of NASA would do for me).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In my home country, I had access to an excellent natural sciences education from an early age and I pursued a very specialized path that led me to study physics. I received my undergraduate degree in physics from the University of Zagreb in Croatia in the department of the Faculty of Science. After that, I came to the United States to continue as a graduate student in physics at Duke University.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Throughout my education I was very active in amateur astronomy, especially with meteors and variable stars. Physics was my training, astronomy was my hobby. It was only after graduate school that I started to think that I should make my hobby, my career.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, this was not the easiest thing to do. As a physicist, I was a bit too much of a \"black sheep\" to the astronomers, and I had to wait a few years before I could submit my resume to NASA's <a href='http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/' target='_blank'>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</a> (JPL). I was a Caltech postdoc at the time, working on some very non-space stuff, and I was lucky that the group supervisor of Solar System Dynamics at JPL Don Yeomans decided to give me a chance. Shortly after I started, the late JPL astronomer Steve Ostro also gave me a chance to try my skills on radar observations of asteroids. I've been at JPL since 2007 and I've been having a blast.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I grew up watching the famous astronomer Carl Sagan and his <i>Cosmos</i> series. That show (and book) really had a profound influence on me.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is a physicist? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>For me, being a physicist is a set of skills and a way of thinking that I use when I solve problems. The research that I do is very diverse, but I like it that way. I currently work on near-Earth asteroid research where we use the Goldstone and Arecibo radar telescopes to study asteroids.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I also work on the orbits of outer planet satellites. One of the great perks of working at NASA is being able to participate in space missions. I've recently joined a hazard team for the New Horizons mission that is headed for the first encounter with the Pluto system. Our team has to make sure that the path of the spacecraft is clear of any unexpected small satellites. I'm very excited to work so closely on operations vital for the mission's success and I cannot wait to see the flyby data from the Pluto system and later on, the Kuiper Belt.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career. </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This was back in 2009 when my good colleague Lance Benner and I were looking at the first radar echoes from a near-Earth asteroid called 1994 CC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As is the case with most asteroids that we observe at Arecibo and Goldstone, not much was known about this asteroid except a very rough estimate of its size. As soon as the first radar echoes were received by our antenna at Goldstone, we understood that this was a very unusual asteroid: it had two small moons orbiting it. This was only the second time that such an object was observed in the near-Earth population.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>First and foremost, never listen to anybody who tells you what you can and cannot do. Second, never pass up an opportunity for an interesting research project even if it takes you out of your \"comfort zone.\" Careers span many decades these days and you want to remain curious and to keep on growing as a researcher.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I like to travel. I guess that after my home-town, my favorite city is London. I also enjoy reading Sci-Fi. My favorites are the works of Alastair Reynolds, Greg Bear, Louis McMaster Bujold, and many more.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I would advise students to start building their skill sets (engineering, physics, math, computer sciences) as soon as possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Furthermore, I would advise them to find a field that they <i>love</i> as opposed to <i>like.</i> Only love will give them the fuel needed to push through all the challenges on a long career road ahead.</p>\r\n",

Specifically, I was raised in Thibodaux, La., a town of about 20,000 people, which is just south and west of New Orleans. I live in Hartselle, Ala., now.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Describe the first time you made a personal connection with outer space. </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It was in elementary school. I was the kid who brought a portable black and white television to school to watch the Gemini and Apollo program launches. Of course I asked permission of my teachers to bring the set into the classroom, and it was encouraged -- I had great science teachers. It was a wonderful experience to be able to watch a live launch from school.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin clearfix'></div>\n<div class='quote'>\n\"Listen to your parents or your teachers ...<br />\r\nalong the way prepare your heart and your<br />\r\nmind to serve mankind and your country's<br />\r\ndesire to explore.\"\n</div>\n<footer>\n<cite>- Mark Boudreaux</cite>\n</footer>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin'></div>\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>How did you end up working in the space program? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It was my childhood dream. I knew I needed a degree in physical science or engineering to be considered for this type of work and so I went to school at a state-run university in Louisiana, where I earned a degree in chemical engineering. Upon graduation I applied to NASA for an engineering position at <a href='http://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/home/index.html' target='_blank'>Kennedy Space Center</a> (KSC). I traveled down to Florida for the interview, and fortunately I scored very well and they hired me. At that time, the Space Shuttle program was gearing up and they needed skilled people. KSC trained me as an engineer in flight hardware, and ever since that first day I have been processing flight hardware. I worked 12 shuttle flights in six years before leaving KSC in 1990. It was very exciting work. I have been a civil servant for NASA for just about 27 years now.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Originally I was inspired by my father, an engineer; and my mother, a homemaker. My godmother was also very influential in my life. I come from a long line of educators: My aunts were schoolteachers. My family always encouraged me to invest in my studies and go on to college. There was never a question of if I was going to attend college; it was more of a question of when.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In our local city school system we had some highly motivated math and science teachers who supported the physical sciences and the exploration of space. My education began back in the 1960s when our country's initial interest in space was obviously captured by President Kennedy with his bold goal to land a man on the Moon in the decade. And so I think the teachers, students and parents -- the whole generation -- were caught up in that excitement, enthusiasm and wonder, and I was too.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is a Project Manager? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Primarily I am a NASA project manager at <a href='http://www.nasa.gov/centers/marshall/index.html' target='_blank'>Marshall Space Flight Center</a> (MSFC). A project manager is a leader of a group of individuals focused on a common goal or product. My most recent project leadership assignment, which I was pleased to be a part of a team of an outstanding group of scientists and engineers, was the development of a low, free flying orbital spacecraft called FASTSAT (Fast, Affordable, Science and Technology SATellite). (We launched this spacecraft in November 2010 and are currently performing mission operations.) FASTSAT has six instruments and weighs 165 kilograms. It was launched into a near polar orbit at about a 72 degree inclination, from the island of Kodiak, Alaska. Its primary goal is Earth-viewing research and technology. NASA supports three Earth-viewing space weather and atmospheric research science activities flying on this mission.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career. </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I have been fortunate to be a part of NASA my entire working career, and to have experienced several exciting moments. Besides having had the pleasure of working alongside some of the most talented engineers and scientists from across the globe on more than a dozen launches, there is a particular moment that stands out. I can tell you that I was in a state of awe the first time I climbed aboard a space shuttle to perform a flight instrument test. (This was the Space Shuttle Challenger.) I remember pinching myself and thinking: \"How did a small town guy like me get himself into this incredible situation?!\" Since then I have had the pleasure of performing operations in other space shuttles and on other spacecraft and launch vehicles, and each and every time it is exciting, but I will always remember that first time.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My recommendations would be to listen to your parents or your teachers, to study and to find a way to go to an accredited university or place of higher education (such as a technological or vocational school) in order to acquire a scientific degree. That in itself will help springboard you for the rest of your life. It is also important to apply yourself and make an effort to do your best in your studies, and to work to become well-rounded in all areas of your education. There are some other enablers -- you should try to get an internship with NASA or one of its aerospace industry partners prior to your graduation to set yourself apart from the rest of your classmates. Also, along the way prepare your heart and your mind to serve mankind and your country's desire to explore.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I relax and spend time with my family and my friends. I do enjoy drawing caricatures and doing woodworking projects (I whittle and I have a lathe). I also have a passion for outdoor landscaping. I enjoy being outdoors and viewing the fruits of my labors.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Stay the course. Don't let your disappointments or your failures overwhelm you. We have all experienced failures at some point in our lives. These disciplines (science and math or engineering) are the platforms from which you can be successful, and contribute in a positive manner to your community.</p>\r\n",

      "body": "<h3><b>Where are you from? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I was born in Montebello, Calif. It's a small town east of Los Angeles, part of the urban sprawl that is the Los Angeles Basin. When I was very young, there were still some large fig groves in the area, but by the late1960s they were all turned into housing developments. Other than one summer in Boston, I've always lived in California, most of it in the Los Angeles area.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Describe the first time you made a personal connection with outer space. </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I was born in 1962; the year after the first humans went into space, so I grew up with the space program. I remember my dad and older brother watching the launches of Gemini and Apollo, and everyone being excited by the Apollo 11 moon landing. Since they were excited and interested about it, I paid attention too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My brother was also always building model airplanes and spacecraft, and I imitated him. So my getting interested in space was a gentle, slow process, based mostly on imitating my brother. There were two or three \"Gee Whiz!\" moments though, that qualified as times where I stepped back and really became aware of a personal connection. The first was the day of the Apollo 11 landing. During the first moonwalk, I remember going outside and looking up at the moon, and thinking that there were people up there, right then. It was an exciting, but also creepy feeling that stuck with me for some time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another memorable moment was the Viking 1 landing on Mars in 1976. I was 13 years old. I don't remember the landing itself, but I do remember seeing the first images of the rock-strewn landscape. It was an amazing combination of the familiar (ground, sky, rocks), and alien (the red colors and the total lack of vegetation... I've seen similar places on Earth since then, but at the time it was totally bizarre to me). I could picture myself walking around on this other planet, and I wanted to try it!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A third connection, and the one that was probably my first entirely self-directed one, happened during the1980 and 1981 flybys of Saturn by the Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 spacecraft. By that time I was old enough to be choosing things on my own, as my brother had gone off to college. I remember discovering that a local PBS TV channel had extensive real-time coverage of the missions during the planetary encounters. I chose to spend a lot of time watching that coverage and learning about the planets. From that point on I was always on the lookout for planetary science-related books, news and events.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><blockquote>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin clearfix'></div>\n<div class='quote'>\nTo me, being a scientist means seeing something in nature and wanting to figure out how it works or why it is the way it is.\n</div>\n<footer>\n<cite>- Mark Hofstadter</cite>\n</footer>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin'></div>\n</blockquote></span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>How did you end up working in the space program? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I was always interested in space as a hobby: building model rockets, reading about the space program, stuff like that. I didn't really think about it as a career until I was graduating from college with my bachelor's degree in physics and didn't know what to do next. I did not want an advanced degree in physics, so looking for a job seemed like the thing I had to do. That's when I realized that, since I always liked planes and space, I might as well try to work in the aerospace industry. I ended up getting a job at the <a href='http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/' target='_blank'>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</a> (JPL) as a contractor. This job was not very interesting, but I was impressed by what the scientists around me were doing. That made me decide to go to graduate school in astronomy, and I applied to a few astronomy departments. Then I saw that some schools offered a degree in planetary science. I didn't know what the difference between planetary science and astronomy was, so I did a little research. I found that most planetary scientists studied objects to which we could actually fly a spacecraft, or on which a human might someday walk. To me, studying something that I might one day get to touch sounded a lot more exciting than looking at things so far away that I'd never see them clearly, so I switched and ended up going to graduate school for planetary science. From that point on, working in the space program was obviously where I wanted to be. It combined my interest in objects that are <i>out there,</i> but not so far away that I (or my robot) couldn't get there.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My older brother was probably my biggest inspiration. I saw that he was interested in space, and he convinced my parents to buy a small telescope. Then he built his own six-inch reflector and hosted star parties. I started out just by tagging along, but soon decided that it was fun!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is a Planetary Scientist? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Every scientist does things a little differently than his or her peers, but to me, being a scientist means seeing something in nature and wanting to figure out how it works or why it is the way it is. Why is the sky blue? Why does Jupiter have a giant storm on it (bigger than the entire Earth!) that has lasted for more than 400 years? These are the kinds of things I like to think about. One of my colleagues describes it as, \"A scientist likes to figure things out.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some of the day-to-day details of my job are:<br />\r\n1) Planning new observations of planets that will answer interesting questions about them.<br />\r\n2) Looking at measurements I've already made to figure out what they mean.<br />\r\n3) Talking to colleagues for new ideas and help in figuring things out.<br />\r\n4) Writing requests (we call them proposals) to either use a particular telescope, or to get the money needed to build a spacecraft or to conduct research.<br />\r\n5) Writing reports on things I've learned, so that other scientists can build upon what I've done.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment in your career. </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>One of my favorite moments is the first observing run I had completely on my own. I had just received my Ph.D., and I requested two days of time on a radio telescope (the Very Large Array (VLA) in New Mexico) to look at Neptune. I chose the project, I was awarded the telescope time, and it was up to me to make it all happen. My observations started in the early morning (something like 4 a.m.), and I remember waking up and walking from the dorm area to the control room. It was a cold, dark, beautiful night, with some patches of snow on the ground. Out by the dorms I stopped, looked out at nature, and took deep breaths of the crisp air. I felt connected to the world around me, like what often happens on a camping trip when you get far away from everything man-made. Then, as I walked to the control room, I began seeing all the big radio dishes (there are 27 of them at the VLA), and heard the hum of equipment and the whir of motors. I was struck by the contrast between a nature-filled winter's night far from any city, and the high-tech equipment all around me. And I began thinking about how all 27 of those antennas were about to swing around and stare at a little patch of the sky that I selected, and I was going to see things on a planet that nobody else had ever seen. It was a fabulous feeling of being excited about what I was doing, and being a little scared that I might mess something up. And the best thing about that experience is it pretty much feels the same way every time I go observing!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give someone who wants to follow the same career path as you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The first thing I always tell people is that they should do something that interests them and is fun. I also point out that <i>fun</i> does not mean <i>easy.</i> I think facing challenges is part of what makes my job exciting. If you want to work in a scientific or engineering field, you will almost certainly need a bachelor's degree, and probably a Ph.D. if you wish to do research. Taking a lot of math in school is likely to be useful. (For me, math is one of the challenges I deal with... I really don't like it, but it's a powerful tool that lets me do exciting things.) I also think that having a wide breadth of knowledge is important. While scientists tend to focus on a particular topic -- mine is the atmospheres of planets -- it helps to know things about other technical areas, such as geology, oceanography or chemistry.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Beach volleyball. As much of it as possible.</p>\r\n",

If I hadn't spent my summers in the Upper Peninsula, I doubt I would be a geologist today -- it's an amazing feeling to know you are standing on rocks that are over one billion years old!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Describe the first time you made a personal connection with outer space. </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>When I was a kid, I used to lie on our dock and stare up into space trying to grasp just how big the Universe was, how long ago the light left the stars before it reached me and much more. I knew then that I wanted to be scientist and learn more about the world and the Universe around me.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>How did you end up working in the space program? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I always loved all areas of science; however, geology seemed like a good choice for me since it applied all kinds of science -- biology, chemistry, physics -- to study the natural world. I took physical geology as a freshman in college and I was completely hooked. As a geologist you can look at rocks and tell fantastic stories about the processes and environments in which they formed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was introduced to planetary geology in grad school. My advisor gave me a choice of many projects to work on and I decided to try modeling chemical weathering on Mars. I haven't looked back since!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is an Assistant Professor of Geochemistry? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I teach and do research in the School of Geology and Geophysics at the University of Oklahoma.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I spend about half my time on teaching: \"Introduction to Geology,\" \"Geochemistry,\" \"Planetary Geology,\" and a technical writing class called \"Geowriting.\" The rest of my time I spend working with students in the lab.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I study the geochemistry of planetary materials and how they react with water at the surface of planetary bodies. For example, my students and I conduct experiments where we measure how long it takes for minerals to dissolve in water. We also mix gases and ice to try to form materials called gas hydrates. I use these experiments to test hypotheses on how long water might have been present in some areas of Mars as well as the source of methane on Mars, which has recently been observed in Mars' atmosphere.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>When I was in graduate school, the Mars rover Opportunity landed at Meridiani Planum. A few weeks into the mission the team held a press conference -- I was watching the tiny TV in the lab with my lab mates when they announced the discovery of a mineral called \"jarosite\" in the rocks they were exploring. I was so excited -- jarosite is an iron sulfate mineral that had been popping up in the models I'd been running of chemical weathering on Mars! Sometimes you just happen to be doing the right thing at the right time ...</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My high school science teacher was always so excited about learning and exploring new things. He would take us out in the field to collect water samples, or test rockets or explore caves. He had so much energy and enthusiasm for teaching and science that it was infectious. He inspired me and many of my classmates to become scientists.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My advice would be to set moderate-term goals and work towards them every day. At times it can seem overwhelming, but if you can see how each small step you take leads you to your goals it becomes more manageable. Life as a scientist can be busy and at times frustrating, but it is also very rewarding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, I'd like students to know that you can be a successful scientist and have interests outside of the lab as well. There are many young scientists now who balance work and family or hobbies. Even though people like to \"brag\" that they spend 80 hours a week in the lab; that is not actually the norm. You can be a productive and successful scientist for 40-50 hours a week.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I like to read, hike and kayak with my family. I especially like to explore nature with my daughters.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Have fun with it. Science, math and engineering can be hard sometimes, so it's really important to find the fun stuff that makes you excited to learn more. The bonus is that science, math and engineering are part of almost everything, so it's usually pretty easy to apply them to the things you love to do.</p>\r\n",

The science operations for the Hubble Space Telescope are performed at STScI in Baltimore, which is on the Johns Hopkins University campus. After 13 years in that job, I moved to <a href='http://www.nasa.gov/centers/marshall/home/index.html' target='_blank'>NASA Marshall Space Flight Center</a>, where I have been for the last six years, except for one year at NASA Headquarters in 2005-2006.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My high school calculus teacher, Mr. Roger Harms -- my excellent training in calculus allowed me to become a successful scientist; Carl Sagan, who I admire immensely for his broad and deep intellect; Cecelia Payne-Gaposhkin, whose autobiography inspired my quest for respect and equality for women in science; Dr. Dorritt Hoffleit (at Yale University), who I worked for one summer on Nantucket; Dr. Margaret Kivelson (UCLA), who encouraged me when I was a very young scientist, providing me with sorely needed confidence to continue on as one of the few women in a male-dominated department.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is a chief scientist? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Someone who constantly encourages, supports and articulates the value of science in a largely engineering agency. I provide high-level scientific leadership and strategic direction for the Marshall Space Flight Center. I also chair the American Astronomical Society's largest division: the <a href='http://dps.aas.org/' target='_blank'>Division for Planetary Sciences</a> (1,500 members), and I am an associate scientific editor for The Astronomical Journal.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career. </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1975 I was one of only a handful of people in New England who witnessed the occultation of asteroid Eros by the star Kappa Geminorum. In order to see it we drove at break-neck speed south to intersect the ground track of the occultation -- because it changed at the last minute. We drove as far as we could before pulling off the interstate and onto a field, and it was a miracle that we got to see it happen. My results indicated that the asteroid had an elongated potato-like shape, which was controversial. (At the time people thought asteroids were all round.) This was proven to be correct later when the NEAR mission went to Eros.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The comet Shoemaker-Levy impacts with Jupiter were one of the highlights of my career. I led two of the six Hubble Space Telescope observing proposals. The team was fantastic, the anticipation was so exciting, and the results were truly astonishing and unbelievable. The press conferences, radio and TV appearances, and then a year of lecturing about the results all over the world were incredible. I still have a copy of the telegram we received, announcing that the ground-based infrared observers had seen bright fireballs. When we got this telegram we were nervous that Hubble might not see anything. When we saw the first Hubble pictures, it was just an unbelievable moment. (I bought the champagne that the team drank to celebrate, and I still have the bottle on my shelf among my \"astronomical bottle\" collection).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other highlights of my career include my first Space Shuttle launch and the New Horizons launch in 2006. Presenting a colloquium at the Princeton Plasma Physics Lab and seeing my cross section paper on the desks of several of the scientists there was another high point in my career.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If you find something you love to do, it's not a job. You have to be willing to work very hard; that's more important than how smart you are, or where you went to school.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think the quote that has always summed it up best for me is from Cecelia Payne-Gaposchkin's autobiography (\"The Dyer's Hand\"):</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"Do not undertake a scientific career in quest of fame or money. There are easier and better ways to reach them. Undertake it only if nothing else will satisfy you; for nothing else is probably what you will receive. Your reward will be the widening of the horizon as you climb. And if you achieve that reward you will ask no other.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I enjoy reading, gardening, exercising (running, aerobics), travel, studying history, sewing, needlework and knitting. I am a sports fan: two of my favorite teams are the Red Sox and the NFL's New York Giants. I also like Nebraska football, SEC football, ACC basketball and professional tennis. I love to play cards, do Sudoku, and play Tetris, Solitaire, Word Twist and PathWords on the computer.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Do what you love, and love what you do. It takes hard work. Don't fool yourself into thinking that you can be really good at something without being willing to put in long hours to master it. Working hard and being dedicated has allowed me to succeed even though I am not brilliant.</p>\r\n",

Situated in Hutchinson is one of the most amazing museums you'll find anywhere in the world: The Kansas Cosmosphere and Space Center. The Cosmosphere, as the locals call it, is home to the largest collection of space artifacts outside of the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum. My first exposure to space was a family trip my parents took me and my sister on to the Cosmosphere. I don't really know what it was about the place, but I was awed by all the rockets, airplanes and spacecraft, even at such a young age. I think that was the day I became a total space nerd!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first time I really connected with the space program, however, was the launch of STS-95, which was John Glenn's return to space. Now, being only ten years old at the time, I didn't have a clue who John Glenn was or any of the other astronauts. My teachers sure did though, and my class was invited down to the library to watch the launch. And let me tell you, it didn't disappoint. I was hooked, captivated by every moment and the suspense leading up to liftoff. I almost couldn't contain my excitement as I watched Space Shuttle Discovery ascend into orbit. That was the moment I knew I was going to be the guy who builds those rocket ships and fly aboard them. I was going to be a NASA astronaut when I grew up.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>How did you end up working in the space program?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>By mere happenstance. I came to JPL as an Early Career Hire from the Georgia Institute of Technology after completing my master's degree in aerospace engineering. While I was diligently applying for jobs in the space sector, my background in aircraft flight testing was really preventing me from branching out into the spacecraft world. JPL recruiters came to Georgia Tech's annual fall career fair, and, on a whim, I talked with the recruiters, passed along my resume, and thought nothing else of it. Three months later, I showed up for orientation as a flight controller for Cassini. Funny how that works out.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin clearfix'></div>\n<div class='quote'>\n\"STEM is, by far, the coolest field to get into. We fly spacecraft around other planets; how much better can it get?\"\n</div>\n<footer>\n<cite>- Michael Staab</cite>\n</footer>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin'></div>\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My parents and teachers have always been my biggest inspiration and motivation. It was never lost on anyone involved in my life growing up that I was a future astronaut in training. My parents really encouraged the math and science early on, enrolling me in science summer programs and even space camp, while my teachers really challenged and pushed me hard because of where I wanted to go. I've made it clear many times before that I'm only in the position I'm in because of the supporting cast behind me the whole way. Along the way, there were also a number of astronauts who kept me motivated to stay focused on the end goal, even when times got really tough.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><div class='center image_module' style=''>\n<figure class='inline_figure'>\n<img src='/images/content/Staab_Asto_Training_835.jpg'>\n<figcaption>\nMichael (right) and a colleague in astronaut training.\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is a mission operations engineer?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A mission operations engineer focuses on the sustained operations of a spacecraft. In terms of the NASA systems engineering cycle, we're talking about spacecraft in \"Phase E\" of their life cycle. Mission operations includes a number of different activities, such as long-term science planning, background sequence design, orbit maneuver design, and real-time spacecraft flight operations, which is what I do.<br />\r\n </p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career.</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>After only three days on the job, I was already working Deep Space Network (DSN) passes for Cassini. Three days! I think it shows the immense level of trust that the Cassini team has in me to let me start commanding a multi-billion-dollar spacecraft after less than a week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I didn't think much when I sent my first command. I queued the command (a command loss timer reset), enabled radiation at the station, and off it went. It wasn't until I saw the command file register on the spacecraft some three hours later that I really comprehended what I had just done. I sent out a command file from a radar dish on the other side of the world (the 70-meter dish in Canberra, Australia), it traveled through space at the speed of light toward Cassini, registered onboard, and radiated back down. I'm talking with a spacecraft that's orbiting thousands of kilometers per hour around Saturn, which itself is 1.5 billion miles from Earth. Not a lot of people can say they've ever done anytime like that. I feel really honored to be chosen to join JPL and work on this amazing project.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<div class='image_module right' style='width: Michael Staab in SCUBA gear.px;'>\n<figure class='inline_figure'>\n<img src='/images/content/Diving.jpg'>\n<figcaption>\nMichael spends his free time either underwater or in the air.\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Few people can say they get to work on a project that's orbiting another planet and be allowed to \"fly\" it. It was a long road for me to get to JPL, but it was all worth it. My best advice, if you really want something and are willing to put the work in to get it, is don't let anything hold you back. I've been chasing the astronaut corps for well over two decades, and there were many times I wanted to give up. Patience, dedication and commitment are hard to do when the goal is so big and so far away. I wanted to work for NASA my whole life, and now I'm doing that. I'm living my dream, and one day so can you!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I'm a really adventurous individual. I'm an active SCUBA diver, both recreationally and professionally, and you'll find me diving almost every weekend. I go diving for fun and help with teaching new SCUBA students as a dive master with a local shop in Pasadena. I'm also training to become a technical SCUBA diver, both open circuit and with closed-circuit rebreathers, so I'm involved in almost every part of the sport. I'm also a pilot and go flying as often as I can. I'm finishing my private pilot's license this year and will continue toward my instrument and commercial ratings over the next couple of years. I'm also actively involved in triathlons and, on average, race in five events every year.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to a student interested in science, math or engineering?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I can only speak about engineering because that's what I know really well, but science and mathematics go hand in hand with engineering. STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) is, by far, the coolest field to get into. We fly spacecraft around other planets; how much better can it get?! Science teaches us to question the universe around us and ask the fundamental questions about why and how everything works. To be a really great engineer or scientist, you have to be inquisitive. Science and mathematics, and, by extension, engineering, can be a really challenging field, but, as I've previously mentioned, it is the most rewarding career out there.</p>\r\n",

      "body": "<h3><b>Where are you from?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I was born in South Africa and I lived there until I finished my Ph.D. I loved living in South Africa. I love big open spaces and blue skies. But South Africa doesn't really focus on space science, and that is one of the reasons I moved to Europe. I am now living in London. I enjoy living in London, but the weather can be very dreary; I find winters particularly difficult. However, I do live in a really nice part of London, which is close to a park and near the river.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Describe the first time you made a personal connection with outer space.</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It was when I was a young child; I must have been 10 or 11 years old when my dad built his own 10-inch telescope. He ground the mirror, and my sister and I helped mix the concrete for the base of the telescope. When my dad finished putting it together I remember looking through it and viewing the moons of Jupiter and the rings of Saturn. I was so excited to see these objects, of course not knowing that in the future I would be involved with a space mission orbiting around Saturn.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin clearfix'></div>\n<div class='quote'>\n\"You just need to persevere.

I got my Ph.D. and was trained as an applied mathematician in South Africa. When I left South Africa I went to Germany for a couple of years on a fellowship and I worked mainly in applied mathematics. After that I wanted to move to an English speaking country, and so I went to work for the Imperial College in London. After I had been there for six months I was asked by the person I was working for whether I would like to get involved with preparing a magnetic field model for when the Ulysses spacecraft flew past Jupiter on its way to orbit the Sun at its poles. I thought that this was a good thing to do, so I began to work on that, but slowly and surely it took up all of my time. It has now been my focus since 1991.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My dad. I think he was my first inspiration. As a young girl growing up, my dad instilled in me that I could do anything I wanted to do. I never stopped to think that because I was a woman I shouldn't be doing physics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I've worked with some really good scientists who have also helped to inspire me. Margy Kivelson, who is based at the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA), was one of the high profile woman scientists that I have met in the United States. Seeing how well she had done, and how far she had come made me realize that I could achieve my goals too.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is a Professor of Space Physics and a Principal Investigator?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I am a professor of space physics at the Imperial College in London. I spend about half of my time teaching. (One class I teach is an undergraduate class of 250 students on the subject of electromagnetism.) The other half of my time is divided between two other roles I perform in the field of space exploration. I am the Principal Investigator (PI) for the magnetometer instrument on the Cassini spacecraft. In that role I am responsible for managing a team of about 40 scientists, and an operations team as well, to make sure we do good science with the data we get from this instrument. My other role, which takes up a lot of my time at the moment, is that I am the European lead for mission preparations for a new mission to Jupiter called the Europa Jupiter System mission. It is a joint mission for both NASA and for the European Space Agency (ESA), and we have to persuade both that this mission is worth flying in order to get it onto the timeline.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career. </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My favorite moment is linked with Cassini -- in a distant flyby of Saturn's little moon called Enceladus the instrument I am responsible for measured some rather strange signatures in the data. We weren't quite sure what we were seeing, but we did a bit of work on it, and what we thought we were seeing was an atmosphere. (If you have an atmosphere around a body the magnetic field signatures that you see take on a particular shape.) That was a great surprise. So I let the Cassini team know that there was something really interesting going on at Enceladus and I persuaded them to take the spacecraft really close in on one of the subsequent flybys of this moon. I must confess, before that flyby took place, I had a few sleepless nights. (I was concerned that maybe we had misinterpreted the data.) So, my favorite moment occurred when we realized that yes, there WAS this rather strange atmosphere with plumes of water vapor coming off of Enceladus.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Have confidence in yourself. Don't be put off by minor hurdles you might come up against. Be prepared to change direction if something interesting is put before you. If I had been less brave when I was asked if I wanted work on space physics problems then I wouldn't have had all the fun I've had for the last 20 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I go for long walks in the park with friends and family. I swim, and I read. I enjoy watching wildlife, and so I tend to choose holidays where I can take photographs and videos of wildlife. Every so often it is really important to get away from the work that you do everyday, to recharge your batteries and gain your enthusiasm back again.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Persevere. As a student at an all-girls school in South Africa I didn't do physics or chemistry -- they didn't offer these classes. While in college, I decided to take physics my first year -- that was probably the hardest year I have ever had. I would sit in on lectures and everyone else seemed to know what was going on. I didn't have a clue, but I persevered. You just need to persevere. There will be times when you don't think you are doing the right thing, but don't make any hasty decisions. Just hang on in there and you just might surprise yourself.</p>\r\n",

I kept traveling, modeling for several years doing shoots, shows, catalogs, and editorials in cities like Milan, Dubai, Athens, London, Beirut, and Paris.

I gathered a bunch of lumber from our sawmill at the family farm, drove it up to my apartment in New York, and sketched out my design. I cut out the features and built the walls, airbrushed them, and sewed a velvet cushion for the inside. I was having fun thinking of things to add to it, and since my dog was so furry and we were in the middle of a humid Manhattan summer, I tried to put some sort of ventilation in the roof. I found little computer fans on eBay and then stumbled onto lots of chipped and cracked solar cells that provide power at a reduced efficiency, for cheap. I found myself looking up equations to calculate whether the surface area of the roof could be big enough, given the geometry of the base of the house and the reduced efficiency of the solar cells, to power the fan. </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><span>At some point, it dawned on me that I was outside on my own, having fun designing and building something without anyone helping me or without having any kind of real education. It made me wonder what I might be capable of if I actually got an education&mdash;to have people teach me and work with me, and how much I might actually enjoy designing and building things as a career.</span></span><span><span> </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<div class='column-width image_module' style=''>\n<figure class='inline_figure'>\n<img alt='Michelle built this dog house for her dog.' src='/internal_resources/705'>\n<figcaption>\nBuilding this dog house for her dog helped Michelle realize she wanted to be an engineer.\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\r\n\r\n<h3>How did you make the official switch into engineering?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><span><span>After a couple years of being a part-time student at Hunter College, I was &ldquo;adopted&rdquo; by a mentor, Professor Godfrey Gumbs, who helped me get internships doing theoretical quantum optics research at Kirtland Air Force Research Lab (AFRL). After a lot of hard work, I was accepted as a transfer into the Mechanical Engineering program at Stevens Institute of Technology. </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What was it like going back to school when you were 10 years older than your classmates?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>By the time I got into engineering school, I was 28 years old and the other inbound students were around a decade younger than me. They were much more used to using technology&mdash;I hadn&rsquo;t pursued education since before Google was around, so I felt at a disadvantage. I also felt kind of alienated from a lot of my classmates. I spent an intense bout of time in my twenties traveling and working in a very different environment, whereas most of the other engineering students took more traditional paths and may have just recently moved away from home for the first time. It helped me so much to be surrounded by my girlfriends whom I had met throughout the years. They helped me &ldquo;feel normal&rdquo; in college&mdash;to maintain my sense of identity and not feel so culture shocked by the lifestyle change.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>You landed at NASA&rsquo;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory sort of by chance. How did that happen?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><span><span>I was nearing the end of the summer after my junior year in engineering school, and had heard from fellow classmates that if you wanted to go to grad school, you should start applying in the fall of your senior year. I started doing some research to find out what kinds of options were out there and what the grad school application process entailed. I basically stopped searching when I started reading about Caltech. </span></span><span><span>I reached out to a girlfriend whose friend's husband, Capt. David Lehman, worked at JPL. I was hoping she would connect us so I could ask questions about Caltech. </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><span>It all happened really quickly and totally unexpectedly&mdash;after sending him my resume, he asked if I had ever considered employment at JPL. I was floored, thinking simply, &ldquo;no.&rdquo; The next day he passed my resume to the Mechanical Systems Engineering, Fabrication and Test Division at JPL. After a phone interview, they invited me to fly out for in-person interviews. It was super surreal. </span></span><span>When I got the offer later,</span><span><span> I basically jumped around my apartment with excitement on the phone with my girlfriends. I was blown away and knew this could trigger the beginning of a totally new life for me.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><span><b>You're a Mechatronics Engineer. What does that entail?</b></span></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><span><span>Mechatronics is a really fun field that combines mechanical design, electronics, and software. It&rsquo;s similar to robotics and applies to so many modern devices&mdash;almost anything with moving parts that requires power. As a Mechatronics Engineer you can create a mechanism and bring it to life using electricity and code, building a system or device that can perform whatever task you dream up. It&rsquo;s a really creative, hands-on, and interdisciplinary world within engineering.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<div class='column-width image_module' style=''>\n<figure class='inline_figure'>\n<img alt='Michelle lab' src='/internal_resources/712'>\n</figure>\n</div>\r\n\r\n<h3><span><b>What have been some of your favorite projects?</b></span></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><span><span>I&rsquo;m really enjoying the project I&rsquo;m working on now&mdash;it&rsquo;s fast paced for a flight project and I&rsquo;m nonstop surrounded in hardware. I&rsquo;m building and delivering Dual Drive Actuators for Sentinel-6, which is a NASA and ESA Earth observing satellite collaboration. The actuator was originally designed back in the &rsquo;80s by Doug Packard, who also invented the brushless DC motor, and has provided critical motion control for major spacecraft in NASA history, like Galileo, Cassini, and even shuttle missions. The Sentinel-6 Dual Drive will control a mirror which is part of an instrument that will help measure Earth&rsquo;s ocean topography. </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><span>I also loved working on Europa Lander last summer. I worked on the Sampling System team to help build testing facilities at JPL that will help support development of the sampling system for a future Europa Lander. This lander is a really cool problem, since the environment is so harsh with many uncertain variables, such as surface chemical composition and topography. These uncertainties combined with the task of sampling cryogenic ice in a vacuum without affecting or altering what you are sampling is a really awesome engineering challenge. </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><span><b>What advice would you give to others interested in a similar career?</b></span></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><span><span>Don&rsquo;t doubt yourself and don&rsquo;t hold back. You can really surprise yourself when you get outside your comfort zone with the intention to learn. Also, get hands-on, project-based experience. If you have a hard time finding an internship, just build something for fun. Hands-on work is a critical path for driving home engineering concepts, and gives you relevant experience to discuss in interviews.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is your favorite NASA image and why?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I think my favorite ever is probably the famous Hubble Image showing galaxy after galaxy after galaxy&mdash;all in one frame. It&rsquo;s absolutely incredible to try to think about all of the possibility of so many countless new worlds and unimaginable life in all of the planetary bodies in all of the galaxies in just that one photo. It gives me chills to look at it and think about the vastness and limitlessness of space.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><div class='column-width image_module' style=''>\n<figure class='inline_figure'>\n<a href='https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/goddard/2016/hubble-sees-a-legion-of-galaxies' target='_self'>\n<img alt='Michelle Easter Favorite Image' src='/internal_resources/702'>\n</a>\n<figcaption>\nCredit: NASA, ESA and the HST Frontier Fields team (STScI); Acknowledgement: Judy Schmidt\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></span></p>\r\n",

      "body": "<h3><b>Where are you from?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I'm from Waukesha, Wisc., a fairly small town outside of Milwaukee. It was a nice place to grow up &mdash;I spent pretty much any spare time I had at the Milwaukee Public Museum. My Dad would also take me to Yerkes Observatory, which holds the largest refracting telescope ever built (and located in Wisconsin). And Chicago, with all of its amazing museums, was only about a two-hour drive away. I went to college at Harvard University in Boston (another GREAT town), and then graduate school in Atlanta, Ga. After I earned my Ph.D., I got a post-doctoral research fellowship at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, Calif. and started working for the <a href='http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/' target='_blank'>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</a>'s (JPL) Spitzer Space Telescope. After a hugely successful mission, I moved on to NASA's <a href='http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/home/index.html' target='_blank'>Goddard Space Flight Center</a> (GSFC), which is in the Washington D.C. area.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin clearfix'></div>\n<div class='quote'>\n\"Being an astronomer is very much about<br />\r\nbeing comfortable with thinking on your<br />\r\nfeet and coming up with compelling<br />\r\narguments on the fly.\"\n</div>\n<footer>\n<cite>- Michelle Thaller</cite>\n</footer>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin'></div>\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Describe the first time you made a personal connection with outer space. </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I recently spoke to my mother about this, and she confirms that there never seemed to be a time when I wasn't obsessed with space. No one can really figure this out. Neither one of my parents are particularly inclined to astronomy, although my dad did teach geography at the local college and was always telling me about rocks and landforms. Basically, as soon as I was able to talk, I started pointing at the sky and going on endlessly about the Sun and the stars. But there does seem to be something hard-wired into my family. I have since found several relatives of mine who also work for NASA. We had never met before, but we could all trace ourselves back to the same relative, (my great-grandfather) an Austrian/Italian sailor who immigrated to the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>How did you end up working in the space program? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>At first I pursued a purely academic track, and I assumed I would become a professor at a university, but like a lot of people my plans had to be modified when I fell in love and wanted to actually be in the same location as my boyfriend (now my husband). Andrew and I met while I was in Australia, taking data for my Ph.D. research. I was living on the east coast at the time, and such a long distance relationship was hard. So Andrew made a huge sacrifice by leaving his tenured professorship in Australia to find a job at JPL. This at least put us on the same continent. Later, I was able to find a post-doctoral position working for the Spitzer Space Telescope at JPL. That got my foot in the door on a NASA mission, and the rest followed naturally.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Without a doubt, it was Carl Sagan. The \"Cosmos\" television series came out when I was about ten years old, and from the first episode on, I was hooked. Carl had such a way of expressing the beauty and human drama of science, while at the same time being a great defender and explainer of scientific practice and thought. I never had a chance to meet him, but what an incredibly unique person he must have been, with rock-star charisma. (I had a picture of him in my locker all through high school, actually. He really was a rock star to me). There was a music video on \"YouTube\" recently called <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgiXGELjbc' target='_blank'>\"An Even More Glorious Dawn\"</a> that uses clips from \"Cosmos.\" It's classic Carl, and I usually get tears in my eyes when I watch it. Carl could be really cheesy (in the video it begins with him imitating a whale song), but then he leads you into pure inspiration.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is an Assistant Director of Science for Communications? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Beats me. This is actually a very real part of being a scientist at NASA -- many of our jobs are not terribly well defined. While this can be frustrating, it also allows a position to never become stale, but rather to change and grow with the abilities and expertise of the person holding that position. Officially, I represent the four science divisions here at GSFC: Earth Science, Planetary, Heliophysics and Astrophysics. My job is to get the four divisions to work together to do better public outreach and education, but I am also tasked to encourage scientists to work better together internally as well. (Scientists tend to get stuck in tribes with other people who share their same specialty. For example, as an astronomer, I had never gone to a planetary science convention, and I knew next to nothing about Earth science.) At NASA we've got to break down those barriers to be able to function as a whole.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career. </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My mind keeps turning to the interactions I've had with people in places all over the world. (I would have become an astronomer just for the travel.) I've gotten pulled into traditional dances in rural Mexico, appeared on television in Cairo, been dropped on my head while attempting to do a tango \"dip\" in Buenos Aires -- so many adventures.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The most useful thing I ever did in my early education was to join a debate team. Being an astronomer is very much about being comfortable with thinking on your feet and coming up with compelling arguments on the fly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once you're finished with school, I would advise you to not be too rigid or have too specific of an idea of where you want to end up. I wanted to be a research professor at a university, but that's not what happened. Opportunities crop up on their own schedules. You can't force them, and you've got to be able to respond to them when they do happen. I really believe that the changes in my career path were for the best. Maybe you'll meet someone who changes your ideas about where your career should go, or maybe you'll be offered a different sort of job than one you had originally planned. The most interesting careers I see are the ones that went in unexpected directions.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I collect Japanese antiques, mostly by sifting through a lot of Japanese-language websites where people sell old stuff from their attics. I don't read or speak Japanese, but I've gotten familiar enough with some of the characters to be able to navigate my way through. (Translation software is useful once you figure out the eccentricities. For example, if you want to find antique dolls, do a search on the words \"chicken tools.\" Go figure.) I also love dancing and have performed authentic 16th century court dances at renaissance fairs and museums in 100-degree weather, wearing 25 pounds of velvet.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Don't be too concerned if you feel confused all the time. Seriously, I felt very lost through most of my formal coursework. The way science is taught, where a professor sort of dares you to figure it out on your own, left my head spinning. If it weren't for partial credit I probably wouldn't have passed a single class. I don't think science has to be taught that way, but at this point, it's sort of a tradition. However, I'm working very hard to try and change that.</p>\r\n",

At the same time the two Russian probes  Vega 1 and Vega 2, the European Giotto and the Japanese were all in the works. The large international interest and the excitement of building instruments that would fly in deep space was mesmerizing to me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For me, figuring out the most important science questions to ask, which measurements to make and what is the right balance between capability, reliability, mass, power needs, schedule, and cost remains challenging and exciting ever since.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>How did you end up working in the space program? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I study cosmic dust, and dusty plasmas in space and in the laboratory. It was my good fortune to work on this topic as a graduate student just as it was about to \"explode\" into a new and rapidly growing field.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The in situ measurements taken during the comet Halley encounters in 1986 ignited an interest in this field. Since that time, we have recognized dusty plasma processes in action in planetary rings, in the Earth's atmosphere, and on the surfaces of all airless planetary objects. The topic remains of great interest in basic plasma physics, planetary and space physics, and atmospheric sciences.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I am always inspired by the mechanical engineers and the folks in the machine shops at the various institutions I have come across throughout my career who know how to make things work. As do the analog and digital electrical engineers in how they can give a \"soul\" to the boards, chips and wires.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The project managers who can keep things calm, collected and moving forward through the ups and downs of designing and building instruments to fly in space, and the folks who oversee the integration and testing of the instruments delivered to a spacecraft before launch give me inspiration for my work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I find motivation in all of my colleagues who can dream up the goals, and who are willing to relentlessly invest their time and energy to get the data and learn new things about space.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is a Principal Investigator of an Instrument? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A principle investigator (PI) is similar to a conductor of a large orchestra -- standing upfront, waving a stick in the air and somehow making the music fill the concert hall. Without the orchestra he/she would be rather comical!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A PI is responsible for writing a proposal with the right combination of science goals and technical details. If the proposal is selected, then his/her most important assignment is to work with the engineers and scientists to identify the best compromise between the science \"wish-list\" and the realities of the engineering requirements of the mission.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A PI has to push the boundaries, and at the same time manage risk, listen, and learn to compromise, stay humble, and remain capable of making decisions. I'm still learning how to do this.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career. </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In early 2006 we were at the <a href='http://www.jhuapl.edu/' target='_blank'>Applied Physics Laboratory</a> (APL) for the commissioning of the Student Dust Counter (SDC) instrument onboard the New Horizons mission to Pluto. After the initial \"turn-on\" command was sent, it took four minutes to get confirmation that SDC was on ... we all knew that by then New Horizons would be two light-minutes away, but it still remains the longest, most exciting four minutes I have ever experienced -- ever!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Do it! Work hard to convince the single most important critic of everything that you do -- yourself.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I love my job, it is also my hobby -- I enjoy working with students. In order to blow off some steam I like biking, hiking, skiing -- anything outdoors.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Great choices! Let me offer a quote here:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"The miracle of appropriateness of the language of mathematics for the formulation of the laws of physics is a wonderful gift which we neither understand nor deserve\" (E.

As an undergraduate at the University of California at Berkeley (UCB), I worked with professors who were working on lunar and meteorite samples, I selected graduate schools where I could work with faculty involved in deep space flight projects (I was very fortunate to get into the California Institute of Technology and to work with some great scientists there). After I graduated, I worked at the <a href='http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/' target='_blank'>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</a> (JPL) and at Arizona State University, before forming my own company to build cameras for space missions.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My greatest inspiration was my mother, who encouraged and supported me. Professionally, threeprofessors at Caltech very much inspired and guided my development. These men were: Bruce Murray, Robert Sharp and Eugene Shoemaker.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is a President and Chief Scientist? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>When I formed my own company, I was obviously the guy in charge. But I didn't want to be considered just a businessman, so I also used the title of chief scientist in order to reserve some of my time and effort for scientific pursuits. I have five other employees whose principal efforts are focused on acquiring scientific observations and interpreting them with me as well as on their own. Many of the other employees of my company have advanced degrees in science, and are contributors to our scientific efforts. As chief scientist I oversee these efforts and try to set the tone of the research we conduct at my company.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career. </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>One of my favorite moments came when I saw the Mars Global Surveyor Mars Orbiter Camera pictures FHA-01278 and FHA-01279. These showed the most beautiful and extensive layered rocks ever seen on Mars, and very much shook up my view, and that of everyone working with me, of what Mars must have been like long ago.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>For a young person, make sure you get a good background in science (physics, chemistry) and mathematics. And when you work toward an advanced college degree, make sure you include a set of practical capabilities. Being a jack-of-all-trades is not as good as having some fundamental skills.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In the past, my work has been so much fun I didn't really need to be diverted from it in order to have fun. At times in my past, I've been paid to take pictures of Mars every day, look at those pictures and analyze what is going on there. I've been paid to hike around and camp in Antarctica, Iceland and Alaska, studying geology. I've watched rockets take off, and seen things I've built fly to other planets. How much more fun does one need?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, as I've gotten older, my responsibilities have often made my work less fun. (I have to write proposals, administer contracts, write budgets, etc.) To relax from this stuff, I like to process pictures of Mars and other planets and just look at them and think about what they are telling us. But I don't get to do that as often anymore.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As noted above, make sure you get a good foundation in math and science. Then make sure your efforts on advanced topics cover capabilities applicable not only to space exploration, but to other forms of science or engineering. Learn and/or develop and apply a healthy form of skepticism about what you are taught and what you read, but also be similarly skeptical of the work you are doing yourself. You should remember that you learn a lot more from failure than from success, so don't be afraid to fail and to learn from that experience. Find people who know more than you do and try to engage them; shut up and listen to them.</p>\r\n",

      "body": "<h3><b>Where are you from?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I usually say that I was born and raised in Kansas, in the middle of the country, because I identify most with Kansas. I was born in Kansas, but I spent my K-12 years on the Kansas-Missouri border in a suburb of Kansas City, Mo. My grandparents had a farm in Kansas, an hour away, and I spent many happy days there. I went to college on the Kansas side, at the oldest university in Kansas, Baker University. Then I attended graduate school at the University of Kansas, so I became a Jayhawk. I am currently chairing the alumni committee for the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Kansas, so the ties remain.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Describe the first time you made a personal connection with outer space.</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My interest in outer space peaked when I was in graduate school at the University of Kansas. I have liked math since I was a young girl. Once I took physics in high school, became very interested in that, and so was pursuing a PhD in physics. I connected to outer space during my time in graduate school. The Department of Physics and Astronomy had an optical observatory. I had friends at the observatory, and we would go up and look at planets and stars on many evenings.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin clearfix'></div>\n<div class='quote'>\n\"I am interested in the ideas and what you can discover from the data.\"\n</div>\n<footer>\n<cite>- Mona Kessel in her front yard in late spring 2014.</cite>\n</footer>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin'></div>\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Comet Halley (officially designated 1P/Halley) was coming through in '86. There was a lot of interest from the public, and just in general, to see Comet Halley come through. There is not a lot of light pollution in Kansas. We took some telescopes out into the countryside, where we could really get a good view. I took my family out there. It was a really exciting time and, for me, was the spark for outer space.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>How did you end up working in the space program?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>After completing my undergraduate degree in physics, I took a couple of years off to make some money because I was broke after college. I was working in the Kansas City area, so I went out to Kansas University, which was only an hour away, and visited a few times and got to know some people. One person was Tom Armstrong (now professor emeritus, Dept. of Physics and Astronomy, Univ. of Kansas), who ended up becoming my advisor. He worked with the energetic particle instrument on Voyager and had a lot of NASA grants. Prof. Armstrong had a big group, and I just kind of slotted into that group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A couple of the graduate students and I really hit it off, and we talked for hours and hours. They really inspired me to keep doing that kind of work. I'm not an experimentalist. I am interested in the ideas and what you can discover from the data. I am really good at identifying patterns, so that seemed like a natural thing for me to do. None of the other areas in physics appealed to me as much.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is a program scientist?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A program scientist oversees science. For flight missions, the program scientist is responsible for ensuring the mission's science objectives are accomplished. If there are issues standing in the way of this, the program scientist works with the flight mission to mitigate and/or resolve those issues. For competed science programs -- those for which scientists compete for grant funding -- the program scientist is responsible for ensuring the best possible science is awarded and accomplished, overseeing panels, and monitoring awards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am a program scientist in the <a href='http://science.nasa.gov/heliophysics/' target='_blank'>Heliophysics Division</a> at NASA Headquarters, with several other titles under that. I am the executive secretary for the Heliophysics Subcommittee of the NASA Advisory Council, which meets to solicit scientific and technical input from the heliophysics scientific community. I also work three exciting missions: the <a href='http://science.nasa.gov/missions/mms/' target='_blank'>MMS (Magnetospheric Multiscale) mission</a>, the <a href='http://science.nasa.gov/missions/van-allen-probes/' target='_blank'>Van Allen Probes mission</a>, and the <a href='http://science.nasa.gov/missions/twins/' target='_blank'>TWINS (Two Wide-angle Imaging Neutral-atom Spectrometers) mission</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are four sub-disciplines in heliophysics -- solar, heliosphere, magnetospheres (including Earth and other planets), and ITM (ionosphere, thermosphere, and mesosphere), which also includes Earth's and other planets' ionospheres and atmospheres. I am also the magnetosphere discipline scientist for the Heliophysics Division.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career.</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>One memorable achievement in particular was a paper on high-latitude reconnection that was the first observation of a type of reconnection found only at high latitude over Earth's magnetic poles. Reconnection occurs when solar magnetic fields stretched out in space away from the sun connect with Earth's magnetic field, resulting in an explosive release of energy. Because this was the first observation, it made the cover of the American Geophysical Union publication <i>Geophysical Research Letters</i>, back when it mattered because they were print journals. Now everything is online, so covers don't matter so much. Understanding reconnection is a goal now being actively pursued by the MMS mission.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But in a personal level, my favorite moment was when a young researcher, a young woman, told me that I was her role model. I hadn't known her before, but because of that I got interested in her career, and I followed what she has done since. There are a lot more women coming through now, and I recognize that I didn't have a woman role model to follow. My mom worked. She was a secretary when I was growing up. She went on to do other things later, but I didn't have a woman that I could look up to in a career path in which I was interested. I am glad that I can play that role for somebody. Surprised, but glad.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='image_module right' style='width: Mona Kessel (right) and her daughters, Sarah (middle) and Ellen (left), after the DC Rock &#39;n&#39; Roll Half Marathon on March 12, 2016.px;'>\n<figure class='inline_figure'>\n<img src='/images/content/kessel_3001.png'>\n<figcaption>\nMona Kessel (right) and her daughters, Sarah (middle) and Ellen (left), after the DC Rock 'n' Roll Half Marathon on March 12, 2016.<br />\r\n\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There weren't very many women in physics when I was in school. I am one of the first in this area. Both my dad and my stepdad pushed me pretty hard to excel, and to do well, and to try things that women didn't normally do. There was never any holding me back, or \"Don't do this because women don't do this,\" as far as professionally. It was always, \"You go do it.\" They were the first people who inspired me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In high school, the physics and math teacher that I had several times was also an inspiration. I really liked him, and we would talk about a lot of possible career paths. Engineering was what I thought I was interested in at the time because I didn't know that physics was something to do as a career until I got to university.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then, when I was at Baker University for my undergraduate work, my main university professor was inspiring. Baker University was a small place, and we had a joint program with another small university, so they would put students together and university professors from each college. We took classes together. It was a vibrant program in undergraduate physics, and there were a lot of people really excited about what they were doing. It was a fun place to be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During graduate school, my thesis advisor was another one who inspired me. He motivated students by example, by working harder than anyone else. And some of the other graduate students motivated me by how excited they were to be a part of the Voyager effort.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I'll quote what one of my professors in grad school told me, \"You really have to want to do it because it's not an easy career path. Physics is hard.\" If you want to get all the way through a PhD program, it takes some sacrifice and a lot of discipline. That, mixed with a flat funding level, means it's not something that you can absolutely depend on supporting yourself with. You have to get good at what you are doing, and to do that you have to have the commitment to see it through. If you don't have it, then go do something else. That said, if you really want to do it, it's a great place to be.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Right now, it is the season of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) championship. Kansas is the number one seed in the South Division this year (and frequently in the past). I am a basketball fan, and am following the tournament. But my number one fun sport is cycling. I commute to work when the weather is nice, usually from March to October. I like to go on multi-day trips. One of my daughters is an avid cyclist, and we go cycling together a lot. I also like cooking. I like to create new things, and I like to find new cookbooks. My husband cooks also, so we trade off. We both like to eat good food. In fact, that interest is one of the reasons we're married. He is also a physicist and so understands the demands of the job. When I get a chance, I also like reading and gardening. I have a pretty demanding job, timewise. I can only really keep up the cycling because I can commute, which doesn't take too much more time than using the D.C. metro system.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I would tell them that in addition to taking all of the math and science that they can, don't neglect the other areas because they are also important. Writing, in particular, is one of the things you spend a lot of time doing, and also public speaking. You need to be informed in order to present a credible appearance. Be well rounded. Take English, take history, and take other things that you are interested in. Don't just take math and science. Learn a foreign language. We travel quite a bit in this profession, so having at least some familiarity with one or two other languages is helpful because it opens your mind up to the other cultures that you are going to visit.</p>\r\n",

In 8th grade I did a science project about life on Mars. I was able to grow a certain type of bacteria in Mars conditions, using just carbon dioxide, water and volcanic rocks. I've been fascinated with the search for life on other worlds ever since! I studied chemistry in college at Florida Atlantic University, and was lucky enough to do a summer internship at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory my junior year. I started developing a way to detect life in extreme environments; this work was the start of what would become my Ph.D. thesis when I came back to Pasadena the following year, this time as a graduate student at Caltech. After earning my Ph.D. in inorganic chemistry in 2010, I worked as a NASA Postdoctoral Fellow at JPL designing lab-on-a-chip instruments to search for biomarkers, molecules indicative of life. Now as a research scientist at JPL, I continue to explore biomarker detection strategies using both in situ and remote sensing techniques.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My father, also a Ph.D. chemist, has been a huge influence in my life. He taught me to think critically and independently. My triplet siblings, Matt and Casey, have also challenged me to work harder and smarter; they are both the \"other kind of doctor\" (M.D.) and inspire me to never stop learning. I was lucky enough to have met astronauts like Story Musgrave and Don Pettit, who lead by example and help me remember that the only real limits are those I impose on myself.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is a research scientist?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A research scientist is someone who gets to ask questions like, \"Is there life on Enceladus?\" and then figures out how to answer those questions. This can involve doing laboratory experiments, going on expeditions to the field or designing instruments for spacecraft. The best part of my job isn't even finding the answers to my questions -- it's finding more questions!</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='center image_module' style=''>\n<figure class='inline_figure'>\n<img src='/images/content/cable_835_peak.png'>\n<figcaption>\nMorgan Cable atop Mount Kilimanjaro.\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career.</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My favorite experience so far has been camping at the top of Mount Kilimanjaro, the \"roof of Africa,\" for four nights at 19,341 feet (5,895 meters). I was part of a five-person team on a field expedition to sample the Northern Ice Field, a glacier at the summit. Africa is incredible, and the views were spectacular! However, your brain doesn't exactly \"fire on all cylinders\" when you're in an oxygen-deprived environment at those altitudes. We completely forgot to do one experiment, even though we had all of our procedures written down! Luckily it was minor one, and we were able to get lots of fascinating data about life trapped in the ice while we were there.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='image_module right' style='width: Photo of Morgan Cable in the desert of Moab, Utah, with a mountain unicycle.px;'>\n<figure class='inline_figure'>\n<img src='/images/content/cable_unicycle_300.png'>\n<figcaption>\nMorgan Cable enjoying a day of mountain unicycling in Moab, Utah. \n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I do a rather unusual sport for fun -- mountain unicycling.

During the course of the show the presenter announced that a new moon had just been discovered around Saturn. He went on to tell us that this was the first new moon to be discovered in the solar system in over 20 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was amazed by this fact -- this was the first time that I realized that science was not just a bunch of stale old facts and figures from a textbook, but that science was in fact an active field where new discoveries were still being made by scientists.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>How did you end up working in the space program?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I majored in astronomy with a joint minor in geology and chemistry as an undergraduate student (Palomar Community College and the University of Arizona in Tucson). During my last semester at the University of Arizona I took a planetary geology course and fell in love with the subject since it combined my strong interest in all the sciences, but especially astronomy and geology. I then decided to pursue a Ph.D. in planetary science (also at the University of Arizona in Tucson) and began conducting research for my dissertation. Since that time, I have continued my research pursuits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Currently, my research (funded by NASA) focuses on utilizing spacecraft images of other planetary surfaces and what the impact craters we see throughout the solar system can tell us about the formation ages of surface features and the near-surface structure of these bodies (especially the presence/absence of buried water/ice reservoirs).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is a professor?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I am currently a professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Northern Arizona University. I also serve as associate department chair and director of the NAU/NASA Space Grant Program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A professor teaches at the college/university level. Typically, you need a Ph.D. in your specialty in order to reach the rank of a professor, and particularly to work at the university level. How do you become a professor at the university level? You start out being hired as an assistant professor. In this role you must demonstrate your teaching and research abilities, as well as serve your institution and professional community. Assistant professors do not have job security (i.e., the institution can let an assistant professor go at any time). So, after six years of being an assistant professor you put together a packet describing everything you have done and accomplished in order to apply for promotion with tenure. (Tenure means you have job security -- the institution cannot remove you unless you do something really bad.) If you are approved, you become an associate professor. After another six years of demonstrating your teaching, research and service abilities, you can then apply for promotion to the top level of professorship, which is \"full professor.\" As a full professor you are one of the senior members of your institution.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career.</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My favorite moments have to do with my research. I particularly enjoy it when I complete the data collection stage of a research project and then begin analyzing the data. Seeing the results of my efforts for the first time is always exciting! For example, much of my work looks for regional trends in the distribution of crater features indicating excavation into subsurface ice reservoirs. Being able to narrow down the depths and horizontal extent of such buried ice deposits which may serve as the water source for future human exploration of Mars is really thrilling!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Lots of people have inspired me over the years. Carl Sagan's books and his \"Cosmos\" TV program showed me that people can actually make a living doing what interested me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On a personal level, my dad always strongly encouraged my interest in astronomy, as did my high school science teacher (Steve Drew), my community college astronomy instructor (Jim Pesavento), my Ph.D. advisor (Bob Strom), and many of my friends and colleagues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I became interested in Mars due to the first spacecraft images of the planet sent back by the Mariner missions. I continue to be inspired by new results from the various spacecraft missions throughout our solar system.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Don't limit your classes to only what you are interested in -- take courses in other areas of science in order to broaden your knowledge base. Take advantage of any opportunities presented to you -- you never know how that bit of experience will help you in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Do you want to teach at the university level? Universities are looking to hire people with prior teaching experience -- something beyond being a teaching assistant for labs in college. If you don't have that experience, check around at the local community colleges or other colleges/universities in your area and see if they have an opening for an adjunct instructor in science or math.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And learn how to \"sell yourself.\" When you apply for any job you should succinctly highlight your accomplishments. However, be modest about them -- you don't want to come across as a braggart. (\"Selling yourself\" is especially important for women since we are often trained early on to play down our accomplishments.)</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I love to hike and get out among the mountains and canyons of the Southwest. I also enjoy traveling to new locations and exploring their natural beauty and history. Reading is one way that I relax, as well as getting together and catching up with my friends.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Take all the math, science and computer courses that you can in school. However, you will also need to have very good reading, writing and speaking skills to succeed in science and engineering. Foreign language skills are also important since scientists travel a lot and collaborate with international colleagues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The scientific fields are becoming very interdisciplinary, so don't just limit yourself to your major interest -- take other courses which will help you expand your knowledge base. Planetary science is particularly broad, requiring knowledge about surface geological processes, atmospheric dynamics, chemical reactions, various aspects of geophysics, and conditions conducive to biological activity.</p>\r\n",

      "body": "<h3><b>Where are you from? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I was born in Nashville, Tenn., but I have lived in a number of places. In 1937, I moved to Baltimore, Md. where I attended junior high and high school. I lived there for five years before leaving for college (it was my longest home before college). Since 1955 I have lived in the Washington, DC area.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Describe the first time you made a personal connection with outer space. </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I do not remember exactly when I became interested in astronomy, but I know it was at a very young age. I did organize an astronomy club for my friends at the age of 11. We would meet once a week to learn about the constellations. I did not get involved in space activities until I worked at the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) from 1955-1959, and even then only occasionally.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin clearfix'></div>\n<div class='quote'>\n\"If you enjoy puzzles, science or engineering may be the field for you, because scientific research and engineering is a continuous series of solving puzzles.

I knew that taking on this responsibility would mean that I could no longer do research, but the challenge of formulating a program from scratch that I believed would influence astronomy for decades to come was too great to resist.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is a Chief of NASA's Astronomy and Relativity Programs? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As the chief of NASA's Astronomy and Relativity Programs I was involved with planning a program of satellites and rockets with the advice of a wide sample of the nation's astronomical community. I also administered a significant program of grants to support the astronomy program in both its execution and the understanding of its results.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What I liked most about being the chief of these programs was the many contacts I had with researchers that were on the forefront of astronomical research and with the broad astronomical community in this country and abroad. I retired from <a href='http://www.nasa.gov/centers/hq/home/index.html' target='_blank'>NASA Headquarters</a> a number of years ago, and I have since retired from several part time positions.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career. </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>One of my favorite moments in my career was when I realized that I had discovered something important that no one had ever suspected. Upon careful inspection of low dispersion spectra of bright stars similar to the Sun, I noticed that compared to the strength of the hydrogen lines, the strengths of the lines of other elements varied from star to star. When I divided the stars into two groups on the basis of line strengths I noticed that the stars with the stronger lines moved around the center of the Milky Way in circular orbits similar to that of the sun. The others tended to move in more elliptical orbits and to stray farther from the plane of the galaxy. This was the first indication that common stars were not all the same age. These other elements are made in stars and hence increase in abundance as stars die.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It was probably my parents who inspired me most. My father was a scientist and answered my scientific questions, while my mother took me on walks and showed me birds and plants. She also took me out at night and showed me the constellations and the aurora.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My career was quite unusual, so my main advice to someone interested in a career similar to my own is to remain open to change and new opportunities. I like to tell students that the jobs I took after my Ph.D. were not in existence only a few years before. New opportunities can open up for you in this ever changing field.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I attend lectures (on a wide variety of subjects). I also attend concerts and plays. I love to travel. I am active in both my church and the American Association of University Women, and I do a variety of volunteer activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If you enjoy puzzles, science or engineering may be the field for you, because scientific research and engineering is a continuous series of solving puzzles. It is also a continuous process of learning new things, whether you discover them or study the work of others. Science, like all jobs, has its share of drudgery and boredom, but basically it is fun.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><b>Read More</b><br />\r\n*<a href='http://www.mc.cc.md.us/Departments/planet/Nancy/Nancy.htm' target='_blank'>Nancy's Resume</a><br />\r\n*<a href='http://www.womenastronomers.com/roman.htm' target='_blank'>Nancy Grace Roman: An Excerpt from \"Women In Astronomy: Reaching for the Stars,\" by Mabel Armstrong</a><br />\r\n*<a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2movHF4NzA' target='_blank'>YouTube: Nancy Talks About the Hubble Space Telescope</a></p>\r\n",

My father is an astronomer, so we had astronomy and outer space around the house all the time. We lived for a whole year on a mountain while he was observing at McDonald Observatory in Fort Davis, Texas. And I would go with him to the telescope and help out. That was a fantastic experience for a 6-year-old kid.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin clearfix'></div>\n<div class='quote'>\n\"The happiest people I know are ones who think of their field as both a hobby and a job.\"\n</div>\n<footer>\n<cite>- Neil Gehrels</cite>\n</footer>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin'></div>\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>How did you end up working in the space program? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In graduate school, I was involved with the Voyager mission and its flyby of Jupiter. That was fascinating. I spent many hours at the <a href='http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/' target='_blank'>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</a> (JPL) during the mission launch and Jupiter encounter. Then I became interested in the field of gamma ray astronomy. That is observing the Universe in the light of gamma rays. These rays do not penetrate the Earth atmosphere so it is necessary to fly telescopes in space.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I had two advisors as a graduate student at Caltech: Professors Ed Stone and Rochus Vogt.They were the major influences in steering my development and career. I still ask myself what they would do when making decisions.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is an astrophysicist? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There is a lot of blurring between the boundaries between astrophysics and astronomy. For example, when I go to a conference, I often can't tell which people are astronomers and which are astrophysicists. I study stars and galaxies using space telescopes. Gamma rays are part of an astrophysics-type field. They come from hot, violent regions of the universe, like exploding stars, and physics is involved in understanding the sources. Also, the instrumentation comes from physics.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My favorite moment was the launch of the Swift observatory from Cape Canaveral. It was a big rocket, and our work of the previous 15 years was on the line. The launch was picture perfect, and when we turned on the observatory, beautiful images started coming down! The observatory was working properly.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Have fun with it! Incorporate your interest into your everyday life. The happiest people I know are ones who think of their field as both a hobby and a job.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, I guess I should say physics based on the last question. Actually, I love rock climbing and mountains. Big walls are always a thrill. It is great fun now going into the mountains with my wife and children.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><b>Read More</b><br />\r\n*<a href='http://swift.gsfc.nasa.gov' target='_blank'>NASA's Swift Mission Homepage</a><br />\r\n*<a href='http://astrophysics.gsfc.nasa.gov/staff/CVs/Neil.Gehrels/' target='_blank'>Neil's Goddard Space Flight Center Page</a></p>\r\n",

We would lay on the beach at night and my dad would point out the Milky Way and any passing satellites. If we were lucky, our trip would overlap the Perseids and we could get a spectacular show. I remember being enthralled, even despite all the mosquito bites we endured as a result.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The real point of commitment for me, though, was a trip my family took to Kennedy Space Center when I was in college. I was still trying to choose a major when we visited. I knew I liked physics and astronomy, but I also loved music and the arts and was having trouble choosing a path. Visiting Kennedy Space Center not only taught me about the history of our country&rsquo;s space program, but opened my eyes to all the ways in which I could pursue a career in space and be a part of the journey forward. There is still so much that we as a civilization want to understand, and I realized I wanted to help build and operate the spacecraft systems that would enable us to further our understanding of the universe in which we live.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>How did you end up working on the Europa Clipper project?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>After working on the <a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/\">Chandra X-Ray Observatory</a> and then on the <a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/messenger/in-depth/\">MESSENGER</a> mission, I completed my Master's degree in Systems Engineering and I knew that I wanted to continue to focus on payload systems.

What is a Payload Accommodation Engineer?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A Payload Accommodation Engineer's job can vary on different teams, but in general we help negotiate the interfaces between the spacecraft subsystems and the science instruments. As the Payload Accommodation lead on the Europa Clipper Flight System team, my role is to work with the many stakeholders on this mission&mdash;the Flight System, the Spacecraft subsystems, the Payload Office, and the Instrument teams&mdash;to make sure the information that informs the design of the interfaces between the instruments and the spacecraft is clearly captured, and that the requirements on both sides of those interfaces are being met. This collaboration is critical to ensuring that once we integrate the individual instruments with the spacecraft, we will have a system that can successfully gather and return the Europa science data we are all eagerly anticipating.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment in your career.</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There are two that immediately come to mind. The first would have to be the moment when the first MESSENGER images of Mercury reached the ground and I had the opportunity to share that moment with not only my colleagues on the mission, but also with scientists like Dr. Robert Strom, who had been waiting to see more of Mercury since the Mariner 10 flybys in the mid 1970's. My other favorite moment is sort of ongoing: it was, and continues to be, the realization that I get to be part of the Europa Clipper team and work with other engineers at John's Hopkins' Applied Physics Lab, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and the many other contributing institutions around the country to send a spacecraft to Europa. I enjoy my role on this project immensely and couldn't ask for a better team.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I would say that there are many different ways to pursue a career in space and I would emphasize the importance of focusing on the path that aligns best with what really motivates you and makes you want to learn and contribute every day, even when the hours are long and the problems are hard. By studying and immersing yourself in what really inspires you&mdash;be that engineering, astronomy, computer science, math, biology, chemistry, physics, or any other STEM field&mdash;you will bring your unique perspective to the field. It is this diversity of thought that fosters creative solutions to difficult problems.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Outside of work, I've continued to study piano. I also love crafts like sewing, crochet, and pottery. Also, anything Harry Potter.</p>\r\n",

While I remember living in California, I call Massachusetts home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Westford is a fairly small town, and from my childhood bedroom I could see dairy cows grazing on the other side of a corn field. One of the advantages of growing up somewhere fairly rural was the dark skies. Westford is home to both Haystack Observatory and Wallace Observatory. I was actually lucky enough to get to work at Haystack during my senior year of high school.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin clearfix'></div>\n<div class='quote'>\n\"Many people don't realize that it is possible<br />\r\nto get involved in science and engineering<br />\r\nwhile you're still in high school.\"\n</div>\n<footer>\n<cite>- Pamela Gay</cite>\n</footer>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin'></div>\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Describe the first time you made a personal connection with outer space.</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It's hard for me to remember a time when space wasn't a part of my life -- my earliest memories are scattered with space connections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I remember being made to take naps, at the age of five, so I could stay up to watch on TV the images from the Voyagers missions as they passed Jupiter in 1979. I also remember later getting to see contrails of the space shuttle as it came in to land at Edwards Air Force Base. From these experiences I went on be a kid who read science fiction books, while pouring over the science fact pages of \"Odyssey\" magazine.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>How did you end up working in the space program?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I'm an astronomer (I've been employed most of my life as an astronomer). While in high school and through my undergraduate years, I analyzed Very Large Array (VLA) data of T Tauri stars. I later went on to study variable stars and galaxy evolution as a graduate student. But that was all astronomy from the ground, and not space science. I feel like I snuck into the space program through a rather wonderful back door.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2008, while working on plans for the International Year of Astronomy, I became involved in online citizen science. As we worked to find ways to engage the public in astronomy and space science, a group of us realized that NASA data was the answer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many different NASA missions produce so much data that if scientists tried to look at all the data on their own, they'd never be able to make it through more than a small percentage of the images. And there are lots of different science problems that require human beings to look at images for features that computers just can't always identify on their own. We realized we could, in many cases, train the public to help NASA since the tasks that scientists need help with just require people to be able to recognize patterns. Our ideas from 2008 started to become a reality in 2010 with a project called Moon Zoo, a website that asks the public to help identify craters and other features in images of the Moon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From there I went on to build the site Ice Hunters, which asks people to help find the Kuiper Belt object (or objects) that the New Horizons mission will visit after Pluto.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, my time is consumed in building and planning two new sites -- Planet Investigators and Planet Mappers -- which will look at the environments around planets and map the surfaces of planets respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As long as there is a problem with too much data, I hope that I will continue to be able to engage the public in helping the space program.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I'm not sure I can name any one person. I remember being impressed in high school by the work Henrietta Levitt did studying variable stars at Harvard, but at that stage my interest in astronomy and space science had already been present for years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think what mattered more for me may be who it was that facilitated my interest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My dad was always there, handing me books, and when he could, buying me a telescope and sending me to Space Camp. In high school, a regional teacher, W. Russell Blake, taught an astronomy club at my town's community center, and he pushed me to study more and do more. He even helped me go spend six months working at the 6-m telescope in the Soviet Union while I was still in high school.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mentoring has been important to me, and even today, I know that my success is largely thanks to a few key people periodically saying, \"You know, you really should ...\" and encouraging me to do new things and reach for bigger things. We all need someone to push us, and I've been lucky to have a series of people helping me throughout my career.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is a Assistant Research Professor?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>When people ask me what I do, I say I'm an astronomer. Technically, I'm an assistant research professor, which is a complicated way to say that I'm a scientist lucky enough to get to work at a university where I can engage students in helping me with all my different projects. Since I am a research professor most of my time is spent working on research projects for NASA, but I do teach classes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My typical week includes a mix of spending time writing software to allow people to do citizen science, analyzing the results of their work, mentoring my students on their research projects, recording episodes of my podcast \"Astronomy Cast,\" and, of course, attending meetings and telecons. During the less than typical weeks, I get to travel the world and share astronomy and planetary science with others through giving public lectures.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career.</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2010 I was able to attend the \"Communicating Astronomy to the Public\" meeting in Cape Town, South Africa. After the main conference, we were given a chance to go on a side trip to Sutherland Observatory, where we toured the large telescopes and used several smaller telescopes to explore the southern skies. The last night, a group of us from nations scattered across the planet, sat outside talking while watching the sky rotate and waiting for the sun to rise. We were at one of the darkest places on Earth, and just sitting there looking up with our unaided eye was an amazing experience. As dawn approached and the sun brightened, we realized that where we'd settled on the side of the mountain was in the middle of a herd of springbok, and watching them come awake and begin to graze while we sat still in the grass was the perfect way to end the night.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are willing to work hard, and keep working hard, you can be really successful. Having a career in space science is harder than you'll ever imagine. The jobs are very few, the funding is scarce and every year you find yourself wondering if Congress will cut the budget in a way that cuts your job. I work long hours, and I have to admit that sometimes getting everything done on time means working late into the night.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Working in space science isn't an easy path, but if you wake up each day hungry to explore the solar system, the stress is worth it. For many though, it makes more sense to seek jobs in other STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) related fields (many of which pay better!) and to have astronomy and NASA image processing or other forms of citizen science as hobbies. There are many ways to be part of the space science community!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All that said, I have one of the best jobs in the world, and for me the hard work is worth it. I get to help people understand the solar system and define the places of future exploration for spacecraft.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I ride horses whenever I can. I like to jump small courses, and I enjoy constantly learning new skills. It is hard to be distracted by the stress of the day when you're riding a horse and I like being forced to use my brain in a completely different way than I do at work.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Don't ever be afraid to look for opportunities to get involved today. Many people don't realize that it is possible to get involved in science and engineering while you're still in high school. Check your local university, and see if you can work with one of the faculty (especially if you are looking for a science fair project). Check with local companies that do what you want to do, and see if they have internships. Look to start living your future dream right now. The worst that can happen is you don't find a local opportunity, but if you're lucky, instead of serving burgers, you might get to spend high school searching images from NASA spacecraft, writing video games or doing whatever it is that excites you.</p>\r\n",

      "body": "<h3><b>Where are you from? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I grew up in Rovereto, a small town in the mountains of northern Italy -- about an hour north of Verona and about two hours from Venice. I now live in the hills near the <a href='http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/' target='_blank'>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</a> (JPL). I like mountains!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Describe the first time you made a personal connection with outer space. </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Besides the Apollo 11 landing, I would say it was the Viking 1 and Viking 2 landers that first linked me to space exploration. It was so amazing that we could take pictures and command an arm on a probe on another planet! I had no idea that I would end up with a similar job. Mars was so far away at that time!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>How did you end up working in the space program? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1998 I saw a job opening on an Internet mailing list and sent my resume (without much hope) to JPL. I was stunned when I got the call from JPL for a job interview. My first job at JPL was to develop vision systems for ground rovers for the Department of Defense.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My father. He inspired me to explore the world, have an open mind to new things and to never ever stop learning. He was an elementary school teacher, but when I was a kid I thought he was a carpenter since he loved woodworking. He was a good teacher. (I was one of his students for three years.) He was one of those rare teachers that made you learn without you even knowing it.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is a Mars Exploration Rover Driver? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>For quite a few years now I have spent my days driving the Mars Exploration Rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, on the surface of Mars. We do not use joysticks or steering wheels, and we do not drive the rovers interactively; instead we provide a list of instructions to each rover. It is not an easy job, mostly because we have to imagine all the possible negative outcomes of our (rover) actions and make sure the rovers can detect potential dangers and avoid getting into trouble.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career. </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I was personally responsible for the rover Opportunity while driving inside Victoria Crater on Mars. This took about one full Earth year (and quite some gray hair). It was exciting to have a task of such high responsibility and to interact with people I admire.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>You never know what can help you, so learn everything you can! I often used knowledge I gathered while pursuing my hobbies, or talking to friends or reading non-work-related books.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Archery, photography and traveling are what I like to do for fun. My favorite place to travel to is the Valley of the Gods in Utah, near Monument Valley -- absolutely stunning.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Never stop learning -- this will leave your mind open and inquisitive. Curiosity is your best ally. Never just stop and accept the facts as they have been explained to you, but find the roots of knowledge. Use your common sense and your imagination. What would you do if your life, your job, your everything depended on your next decision? Know your limits and push your limits, but also don't be ashamed to ask for help.</p>\r\n",

I am especially interested in the \"big\" unanswered question: \"Is there, or was there, life in our solar system anywhere other than planet Earth? If the answer is YES, then maybe the chances could seem more favorable for life on all the planets being found around other suns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I consider myself greatly privileged to have the opportunity to participate in planetary science and exploration during a time in human history when our knowledge of the solar system is exploding. Robotic tools (such as the mass spectrometers that we develop at NASA's <a href='http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/home/index.html' target='_blank'>Goddard Space Flight Center</a> (GSFC) and send to the planets, their moons and small bodies such as comets and asteroids help make detailed environmental studies possible. These studies can help us to eventually answer the big questions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><blockquote>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin clearfix'></div>\n<div class='quote'>\n\"Robotic tools help make detailed</span><br />\r\n<span>environmental studies possible.</span><br />\r\n<span>These studies can help us to</span><br />\r\n<span>eventually answer the big questions.\"\n</div>\n<footer>\n<cite>- Paul Mahaffy</cite>\n</footer>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin'></div>\n</blockquote></span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is a past planetary mission highlight you can tell us about? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Early in my career here at GSFC it was the Galileo probe into Jupiter's atmosphere. This probe was a big challenge to develop and it took years to get to Jupiter -- all for less than one hour of data as the probe parachuted down into the Jovian atmosphere. But, wow, was it exciting when it got there and definitely worth the wait. The probe with our mass spectrometer sniffing away at the atmosphere sent back data that helped refine our understanding of how Jupiter formed in the past. As with all successful missions, Galileo's results raised additional questions. We hope to answer some of these questions with the Juno mission.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What missions are you working on now? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I am the lead for Mars Science Laboratory's (MSL) investigation of the atmosphere and gases released from soils and rocks (one of 10 experiments on the Curiosity rover). After Curiosity's landing on Mars in August 2012, we spent months working on \"Mars time\" (about a 40-minute change each Martian day or sol from that of Earth-time). We are still busy every week with new data and discoveries from Mars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am also on the MAVEN mass spectrometer team (launch late in 2013 and arrival at Mars in 2014). MAVEN will orbit Mars and measure the composition of the atmosphere. We hope to use data from the MAVEN instruments to help understand how much of the atmosphere of Mars might have been lost to space or to the surface. Was Mars a much more habitable environment early in its history?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I worked on the mass spectrometer that is in orbit at the Moon onboard the LADEE spacecraft.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you expect to learn from your experiment on the LADEE mission? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The moon has a very thin atmosphere. From studying this thin atmosphere we can learn how it is produced and how it changes over time. This also informs our studies of many similar environments in our solar system. The physical models that we get to check by using our data from the LADEE orbiter will help validate these models for other such bodies such as the icy moons of the giant planets.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is the most satisfying aspect of your job? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Really it is working with very talented, dedicated and creative engineers, technicians and scientists who make these instruments and missions possible. It is amazing what can be done when everyone pulls together. There are many different technical and scientific skills that are needed to plan and implement the planetary missions that we work on, so there is room for a lot of diversity in this fun but serious business of planetary exploration.</p>\r\n",

As a kid, I eagerly watched the science fiction movies of the 50s and 60s -- films like \"Forbidden Planet,\" \"Destination Moon,\" \"War of the Worlds,\" and \"First Men in the Moon.\" I was especially taken with the movie \"2001: A Space Odyssey,\" which was breathtakingly realistic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I followed the space program through <a href='missions/profile.cfm?Sort=Alpha&amp;Letter=H&amp;Alias=Human Spaceflight' target='_blank'>Mercury</a>, <a href='missions/profile.cfm?Sort=Alpha&amp;Letter=H&amp;Alias=Human Spaceflight' target='_blank'>Gemini</a> and <a href='missions/profile.cfm?Sort=Alpha&amp;Letter=H&amp;Alias=Human Spaceflight' target='_blank'>Apollo</a>, and kept scrapbooks with news clippings. I made audio tapes of the air-to-ground communications (I still have all of them). I built and launched model rockets. I became a ham radio operator and learned about computers. I loved science in school and planned my future in that field.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin clearfix'></div>\n<div class='quote'>\nIt's always an exciting moment when after studying data, you suddenly have a new insight. That thrill is a high that all scientists seek.\n</div>\n<footer>\n<cite>- photo of Paul Spudis</cite>\n</footer>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin'></div>\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>How did you end up working in the space program?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I always wanted to work in space. I studied electronics and planned to become an electrical engineer. To me, engineers were flying us to the <a href='PLANET:moon' target='_blank'>moon</a>, but I'd always had a strong interest in science so I switched to physics. After watching the great job the Apollo 15 astronauts did during their flight in 1971, I was convinced that geology was essential to understanding the moon, so again and for the last time, I switched majors.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Many people have inspired me over the years:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dave Scott, the Commander of the Apollo 15 mission. Besides understanding geology, he could communicate effective and contagious enthusiasm about it and about exploration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I changed my major to geology in part because of Tim Mutch's book \"The Geology of the Moon: A Stratigraphic View.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ron Greeley gave me my first job in the business and showed me the life of a productive and conscientious scientist; he was my mentor and Ph.D. advisor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Don Wilhelms (of the U.S. Geological Survey) typifies, more than anyone else, the historical, image-oriented approach to lunar history that I have tried to build upon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I owe a lot of my inspiration to these people and to many more.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is a lunar geologist?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A lunar geologist studies how the Moon evolved through time by looking at images, remote sensing data and lunar rocks and soil to recover that information and put it all into context. It's always an exciting moment when after studying a variety of data, you suddenly make some connection or have an insight that wasn't perceived before. That thrill is a high that all scientists seek.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career.</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I've had many, but one of my favorites was during my involvement in the 1994 <a href='missions/profile.cfm?Sort=Alpha&amp;Letter=C&amp;Alias=Clementine' target='_blank'>Clementine</a> lunar mission. We'd fired the rocket engine inserting the spacecraft into lunar orbit and were waiting for the first images of the moon to be downloaded. We were sitting in the control center and watching the big projection screens as the first pictures came in. I saw and recognized the crater Nansen, near the north pole of the moon and immediately felt that I'd arrived home. That simple recognition gave me a great thrill -- I had always wanted to be part of a lunar mission, and for the first time I had an intimate connection to the little spacecraft orbiting the moon, 400,000 km away.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Learn as much science and math as you can, not just the parts that interest you, but all science and math. Research is formulating an answerable question -- learning just how to do that takes practice and the sooner you start, the better. You also need to learn how to write and speak well. A scientist must be able to communicate their ideas. I would encourage acquiring an understanding of history, politics and economics -- making a living by working in the space program requires integrated knowledge of these fields.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I play golf and I read a lot (especially history). I spend time with my family, and I enjoy my grandchildren and sharing my interests with them, including some of the music, movies, cartoons and television shows of my youth.</p>\r\n",

My first time observing, I saw the moons of Jupiter, which was very exciting. During the second time observing, the telescope slid off the ledge of my second story bedroom window and fell to the ground. I was heart broken. Later, my brother and I saved up money from summer jobs to buy a better telescope. I enjoyed hunting the Messier objects with the telescope, but what made a lasting impression on me was the time I woke up early one morning to watch the Perseid meteor shower.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin clearfix'></div>\n<div class='quote'>\n\"It is surprising how much you can achieve if you really like your job.

After graduating, I was invited to work with Dr. David F. Blake at the NASA-Ames Research Center on the study of astronomical ices using a modified electron microscope.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I was inspired by Hans Betlem and the late Rudolf Veltman, amateur astronomers and students at Leiden University, who had just founded the Dutch Meteor Society. People around me regarded my meteor observations as a hobby, more akin to following the weather than doing actual astronomy. But Hans and Rudolf wanted to observe meteors in order to help understand the astronomical origins of meteor showers and to help find meteorites. Amateur astronomers are still my biggest fans and make many of my projects possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is a Research Scientist? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A scientist works to learn new things from observations, theory and experiments. Much of that comes from using new tools and techniques. As a research scientist with the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) Institute, I study what meteor showers and meteorites teach us about comets and asteroids, the origin of the Zodiacal cloud and our own past and future.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career.</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Leonid storm of 1999 is still the most intense meteor shower I have observed to date. We flew 72 researchers and crew in three aircraft from Israel to the Azores at the time, and were rewarded by a spectacular display of meteors, fireballs, elves and sprites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have particularly fond memories of the return of the 2006 Stardust capsule, the 2008 re-entry of European Space Agency's Automated Transfer Vehicle and the 2010 return of the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency's Hayabusa spacecraft. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>My most unusual mission to date was not an airborne campaign at all, but a search for the remnants of a small asteroid, called 2008 TC3, which was the first asteroid to hit Earth that was observed entering Earth's atmosphere. It crashed in the Nubian desert of northern Sudan. I teamed up to comb the desert with Dr. Muawia Shaddad of the University of Khartoum and 150 of his students. What we found changed our views of asteroids and their relationship to meteorites.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Dream big and don't give up. Many times my career was about to die with no funding in sight, and skeptical peer reviews or disastrous world events standing in the way of a proposed mission. For example, the Leonid campaign of November 2001 was incredibly difficult to organize so shortly after the events of September 11, but ended up being one of my most rewarding to date. The 2001 Leonids were truly spectacular here in the United States, and the event was subsequently named the number one news story in astronomy. Even though I was the Principal Investigator of the mission, I was grounded because I was still a foreign national at that time. And so I watched the team take to the sky and then drove to nearby Red Rock Canyon State Park (in California). It was great hearing the \"oohs\" and \"aahs\" around me as we saw red and green meteors pour out of the Leonid radiant. It was like standing in Ten Forward in an episode of \"Star Trek.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My work does not leave much time for other fun projects.

It is surprising how much you can achieve if you really like your job. I would also advise to share your experiences freely, because a great adventure shared is a great adventure lived.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><b>Read More</b><br />\r\n*<a href='http://airborne.seti.org/' target='_blank'>SETI Institute's Airborne Astronomy Page</a><br />\r\n*<a href='http://airborne.seti.org/hayabusa/' target='_blank'>SETI Intitute's Hayabusa Re-Entry Campaign</a><br />\r\n*<a href='http://asima.seti.org/2008TC3/' target='_blank'>Recovery of Pieces of Asteroid 2008TC3</a><br />\r\n*<a href='http://leonid.arc.nasa.gov' target='_blank'>Leonid Observing Campaign</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Links to Videos, Stories, etc.</b><br />\r\n*<a href='multimedia/videos/Hayabusa_Reentry.mov' target='_blank'>Hayabusa Re-Entry Video</a><br />\r\n*<a href='http://a1862.g.akamai.net/7/1862/14448/v1/esa.download.akamai.com/13452/flash_stream/ATV_Reentry.swf' target='_blank'>ESA's Automated Transfer Vehicle Re-Entry</a><br />\r\n*<a href='http://stardust.jpl.nasa.gov/anim/stardust_reentrya.mov' target='_blank'>Stardust Capsule Re-Entry</a><br />\r\n*<a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMNJ18pWKW4' target='_blank'>Peter at Work</a></p>\r\n",

I then moved to Los Angeles, Calif. and went to high school in Arcadia and then the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) for college. I now live in Tempe, Ariz.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Describe the first time you made a personal connection with outer space.</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I am a product of the Apollo era. I was about 10 years old when the astronauts were first going into space, and I fell in love with it.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin clearfix'></div>\n<div class='quote'>\n\"I always tell students that if you want it bad enough you can do it.

I don't remember seeing it, but what I do remember is being outdoors with a bunch of adults who seemed to be worried about something -- something I didn't understand at the time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I was in the sixth grade I talked my mom into letting me stay home from school to watch live pictures coming back from Mars on television. (I thought that it was pretty cool that we were getting live pictures from Mars.) My Mom wasn't one to let you skip school for any old thing, but she let me do that, and I have been a Martian ever since.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>How did you end up working in the space program?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I always was interested in space. It never really occurred to me though, that I could be a NASA scientist myself. (The mentality was and still is today that you have to be someone special to be a NASA scientist.) I was getting a degree in geology at UCLA and working for an oil company, when I met a professor named Hugh Kieffer there. Hugh Kieffer was looking for an undergraduate student to work in his lab. I talked to him, and he offered me the job. (This job had me cutting up pictures from the Mariner mission.) In working for him, it suddenly dawned on me that, yes, I could work for NASA, and that working for NASA could be a career for me. I changed direction, and began taking a lot of physics courses so I could work with spacecraft data and computer models, but I've always remained a geologist at heart. I ended up going to graduate school with Hugh Kieffer to study the planet Mars.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>From a distance, the guys who were sending men to the Moon inspired me, but at home, my mom was a major influence for me as a kid. She recognized that I was interested in space and bought me a telescope. She really encouraged me to do well and follow my interests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And Hugh Kieffer was my role model. He was an extremely good scientist, and a really good human being. He is, in my mind, an example of how you do science. He had great integrity, honesty and he was just brilliant. He was a great inspiration.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is a Planetary Geologist?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Much of my work involves being the Principal Investigator (PI) of Mars projects, such as the Thermal Emission Imaging Systems (THEMIS) for the 2001 Mars Odyssey mission. I run these projects, manage research groups and write proposals. I try to do some research myself and I teach. I am a professor at Arizona State University (ASU). I really enjoy it. I teach a freshman class, upper division and graduate courses on the planet Mars.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career.</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the most memorable moments was when I was a graduate student and working on the Viking project back when it landed in 1976. I got to be in the same room as Carl Sagan, Bruce Murray and all the scientists from the Viking project (I think Arthur C. Clark and Ray Bradbury were there as well). They were all sitting around and debating about what we were going to be able to see once the craft landed and started taking in data. (At that time we had no idea if there was life on Mars or not. So far the images we had seen from Mars had all been from orbit and the smallest thing we could see was no smaller than a football field.) I remember Carl Sagan arguing that he thought that there would be vegetation, for instance lichen growing on Martian rocks. It was great to sit there and hear their debate and at the same time know that in only 12 short hours, we would find out the truth. It was a pretty spectacular moment.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I meet a lot of undergraduate students who just assume that they could never get a job working for NASA, but it isn't true. You don't just have to be an engineering or physics major. I was a geology major and it worked out for me. Or students say: \"It is too competitive.\" \"There aren't many jobs.\" Or: \"Will NASA still be exploring Mars by the time I graduate?\" I always tell students that if you want it bad enough you can do it. It has been my experience that the people who are really passionate about space exploration always found a way to do it. So just be committed, be passionate about it, and you will find a way to be involved in space exploration.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My hobbies have varied over time. Lately, I have gotten into woodworking. It is great to be able to use my hands rather than just my fingertips on a computer keyboard. I try to get outdoors to hike. (I became a geologist so that I could work outside.) And I have a salt water aquarium at my home -- two tanks. One is 350 gallons and the other is 250 gallons. They are a lot of fun, but they do take a lot of my time just maintaining them, and the animals inside are finicky -- they let me know if the water is not to their liking.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Take as many quantitative subjects (math, chemistry, and physics) as you can. Planetary science has really grown so that it is really a quantitative field. So you can never have too much math, chemistry, and physics. Everything else pretty much falls into place if you have that kind of background.</p>\r\n",

Then I moved to Greenwood, Ind. from 6th grade on. I got my undergraduate degree at Hanover College, in Hanover, Ind. Then I moved back to Colorado for graduate school at the University of Colorado at Boulder. I spent eight years there (graduate school, post-doc and two years as a professional) before taking a job with NASA's <a href='http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/home/index.html' target='_blank'>Goddard Space Flight Center</a> (GSFC) in Greenbelt, Md., in June, 2009. Now I live in Washington, D.C.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin clearfix'></div>\n<div class='quote'>\n\"Although the space business is hard work, the rewards are more than worth it.\"\n</div>\n<footer>\n<cite>- Phillip Chamberlin</cite>\n</footer>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin'></div>\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Describe the first time you made a personal connection with outer space. </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>At a very young age, I would look through a telescope while on camping trips or just in the backyard. I would look at the planets through a telescope and I recall hearing stories from my dad about the constellations that he would teach me to find, stories about what the Moon was made of and looking to find its craters.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My dad. He is a Ph.D. scientist and college professor (Geology, Earth Science and Astronomy), so throughout my childhood he was always there to encourage my scientific curiosity and answer my questions in all areas of science. We would always do home-based science projects and experiments, and also look up and research answers to how things worked. As a kid, I had a wild imagination.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>You have two job titles. First, what is a Research Astrophysicist? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As a Research Astrophysicist, I get to conduct a lot of research, and study science. This research is not limited to the Sun, but most of my time is spent doing research (data analysis) from existing satellite measurements, and trying to answer questions using these data. As more questions come up as a result of our research, I then work on developing new rocket and satellite instruments to try to answer these questions. This is where the groundbreaking science happens.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Second, what is a Deputy Project Scientist for the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As a Deputy Project Scientist, I coordinate science data coming down from the three instruments on SDO and make sure the satellite itself is meeting all of its requirements (telemetry rates, data storage and dispersal, spacecraft health, etc.). This is fun, because I get to meet a lot of great scientists and I am learning a lot about different types of instruments that I haven't had the chance to work with before. It has been an amazing learning experience in both science and management.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A favorite moment in my career has to be my first sounding rocket launch as a graduate student. I was hired to do data analysis for a satellite instrument SEE and help out with a sounding rocket in support of that satellite. At 22 years old, I was building something that was actually going to be launched into space and had full responsibility of some aspects of it with the trust of my mentor, Dr. Tom Woods at the University of Colorado. When it launched on the 12th of August, 2003, I was watching from a mile away. Everything worked perfectly, and I was hooked. I couldn't wait to get back and analyze the data. I dreamed of having my own rocket in the future. In my short career, I have worked on six sounding rockets and one satellite, the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), which launched in early 2010. On all of these projects, I have played a significant role in building and testing the instruments on them.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Take it! Although the space business is hard work, the rewards are more than worth it. You will discover things that no one has ever thought of before, and do things that no one has ever done before. There is no other job like it out there. There will be some disappointments along the way that come with the job and in the schooling and training leading up to it (I've definitely had my share), but it makes the successes seem that much greater. So, don't get discouraged along the path, and keep working as hard as you can. Also, take as many science, math, and engineering courses as possible. Even if they may not seem to be relevant at the time, they are all worthwhile.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many things (yes, I do have a life outside of work)! I love camping and hiking, and although I miss doing this in the Rockies, there are still plenty of great places in the East now that I have moved out here. I also play a lot of sports and exercise for fun, including rugby, basketball, golf, running, weightlifting, and biking. These help me relieve a lot of stress that comes with the job. I also like to play guitar. Dave Matthews, Jack Johnson, and Dispatch are a few of the bands I like to cover. I have tried writing my own songs, but they end up being very bad, depressing country songs, so instead, I will focus my creative thoughts on designing the next new solar observing rocket instrument.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Work hard and you can do <i>anything </i>you want to do. This world is based on science, math and engineering. If you are skilled in any of these subjects, or better yet a combination of the three, you can do whatever you want. I was never the smartest person, but I worked hard and have degrees in Physics and Math (undergraduate) and Aerospace Engineering (M.S. and Ph.D.), and it is the combination of these that have led me to become an experimental scientist. I know the science, I know the math, and I know how to build things. I am also working at a NASA center and leading the development of the next generation of satellite and rocket instruments to push the frontiers of science.</p>\r\n",

I work with science writers to publish their work and I also work with a team of programmers and designers to make continual improvements to the site. A good website is never done.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of my favorite parts of the job is searching the web and other sources for historical information and images of the early days of the space program. A lot of wild stuff happened at the dawn of the space age.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career.</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I was working at the <a href='http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/' target='_blank'>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</a> on the night the Mars Exploration Rover Spirit landed on <a href='PLANET:Mars' target='_blank'>Mars</a> in 2004. I'd watched the rover being built in one of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's high bay facilities. The excitement was electric as the flight team relayed information as the rover made the perilous trip through the Martian atmosphere and bounced to a stop on the surface of Mars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I still get goose bumps when I think of the first image from the rover -- and the cheers of so many people who worked so hard to get it there.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Ask lots of questions.

And my parents encouraged me to push the envelope and pursue a career that challenged and inspired me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tom Wolfe's \"The Right Stuff\" inspired me because it was about fighter pilots like my dad and astronauts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I also have to give a nod to \"Star Trek.\" Despite some cheesy episodes and movies, the writers have created a wonderful mythology that combines action and pure exploration.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is a website editor?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I'm responsible for writing, editing, maintaining and finding new information to showcase on this website. I work with science writers to publish their work and I also work with a team of programmers and designers to make continual improvements to the site. A good website is never done.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of my favorite parts of the job is searching the web and other sources for historical information and images of the early days of the space program. A lot of wild stuff happened at the dawn of the space age.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career.</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I was working at the <a href='http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/' target='_blank'>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</a> on the night the Mars Exploration Rover Spirit landed on Mars in 2004. I'd watched the rover being built in one of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's high bay facilities. The excitement was electric as the flight team relayed information as the rover made the perilous trip through the Martian atmosphere and bounced to a stop on the surface of Mars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I still get goose bumps when I think of the first image from the rover -- and the cheers of so many people who worked so hard to get it there.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Ask lots of questions. Be persistent. And never stop exploring your options.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I love to travel with my wife and take pictures. I've lugged my cameras all over the world and snapped thousands of pictures just to get those few perfect images. We also love to hang out with our two dogs and we take them with us whenever we can.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I'm also a voracious reader. My favorite novels are \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" by Harper Lee and \"A Confederacy of Dunces\" by John Kennedy Toole.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Stick with it, even when it gets hard. Find a mentor or a study partner and tough through it. One of my greatest regrets is not fully learning the language of the Universe -- mathematics.</p>\r\n",

      "body": "<h3><b>Where are you from?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I was born outside of Chicago, and spent most of my childhood there with a few years spent in Germany during grade school. After graduate school in Rhode Island, I moved to Maryland to work at the Johns Hopkins University/Applied Physics Laboratory (JHUAPL).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Describe the first time you made a personal connection with outer space.</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I was fascinated with space and the planets at a very young age, so it's hard to pinpoint in my memories exactly which one came first. However, there are a few memories that do stand out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Probably the earliest specific memory (and easiest one to put a date on) occurred in February 1979 when I was four years old. It was an eclipse. I was really excited about it, and I remember putting together some kind of a presentation about the planets (the presentation involved a poster with even a diagram) for my aunt and parents either before the eclipse took place or as a result of it.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin clearfix'></div>\n<div class='quote'>\n\"Life is full of ups and downs, but fortunately<br />\r\nfor me, my parents instilled in me a strong<br />\r\nbelief that if I worked hard enough I could<br />\r\nachieve whatever I really wanted to do in life.\"\n</div>\n<footer>\n<cite>- Rachel Klima</cite>\n</footer>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin'></div>\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Other memories include painting the glass on flashlights red with nail polish, so that the light wouldn't ruin our night vision for observing the stars. I also remember visiting a telescope with my dad. I have many, many fond memories of staring at the stars with my dad while camping -- especially during meteor showers.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>How did you end up working in the space program?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As an undergraduate I had been interested in pursuing both astrophysics and geology, but the University of Chicago didn't offer an undergraduate astrophysics program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I started graduate school, I was originally hoping to get a master's degree to help me find a job which involved more \"real\" geology. The professor who would later become my advisor was working on a Mars project, funded by NASA, and thanks to him I was able to become involved in the field of planetary geology. This combined my love of rocks and outer space together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After finishing my master's, I joined the Ph.D. program at Brown University, where I worked on the Dawn mission and the Moon Mineralogy Mapper for the Chandrayaan-1 mission. This is also where I began learning about the technique of reflectance spectroscopy. I loved (and still love) my research, so I was sure that I wanted to do whatever I could to stay in a job where I could keep involved with new missions and planetary research.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My Ph.D. advisor Carle Pieters was a huge inspiration, but I have been blessed with many great mentors and role models for various aspects of science and life as a scientist in general.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Life is full of ups and downs, but fortunately for me, my parents instilled in me a strong belief that if I worked hard enough I could achieve whatever I really wanted to do in life. When I was closer to a \"down,\" I also had teachers or others in my life who said things like, \"I know you can do this\" and that meant a lot to me. Actually, one of those people was my high school honors physics teacher, Mr. Tilley, who just passed away recently. If anyone reading this is an educator or in a similar position, those simple words can have a huge effect on a young person, especially if they don't hear them often.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is a Planetary Geologist?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Planetary geologists study how solid bodies in the solar system formed and evolved over time. This is accomplished through a variety of different types of research, which in general integrate information that we gather from examining meteorites and lunar samples with data gathered telescopically or from orbit around other planets and asteroids. There are also a number of planetary geologists who do field work in extreme environments on Earth as analogues for Marsand the Moon.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career.</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>That's difficult! I really love my job, so it's difficult to pick a favorite. I guess the moment that jumps out at me most right now, was probably in May 2011. I was really excited about the MESSENGER mission to Mercury, which had just gone into orbit that March. Since I work at JHUAPL there were all kinds of exciting things going on with MESSENGER, but I was not directly involved in them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyway, I had heard that there might be some work that needed to be done for another instrument (CRISM on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO)), and I went to talk to Scott Murchie (the principle investigator of CRISM) about it. He asked me if I might be interested in another project, and we went to talk to some other people about it. A few minutes later, I was recruited to help out with calibration activities for an instrument on MESSENGER. I was so excited to be invited to join the project that I almost danced down the hallway celebrating. The next day I realized what a challenge some of the issues would be -- and it has been a lot of work -- but it's been a fantastic way to push myself and to learn new things. Mercury also turns out to be a really fascinating planet with many surprises.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This is intellectually a very rewarding career, but there are aspects of the path through graduate school and beyond that can be both challenging and frustrating. I think that if you want to be involved with self-directed research, you have to really be able to express your thoughts in writing. You don't have to like it, but writing proposals and papers is something that is pretty unavoidable. I think it really helps to put yourself into your reader's shoes and think, \"What do they need to know to understand why this project (or my results, etc.) are so exciting?\" It's also very important to seek out mentors and role models that embody what you think is important in life. When things get tough, it really helps to have someone to look to (and ideally to talk to) to remind yourself that it can be OK.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I'd also highly recommend that you sometimes take a step back and realize how cool your research is: It's easy to become so entrenched in a project, especially in graduate school, that you lose perspective and enthusiasm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I could go on for way too long on this question, but I'll just add one more thing: Don't be afraid to push yourself and learn new skills, yet don't be afraid to ask for help and collaborate.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I love to play with my son (who is almost 3), and we like to get away on weekends and explore our area or go apple or berry picking (if they're in season). I love camping, swimming and bike riding, so as my son gets a little older we'll probably do a lot more of those things.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I'm trying to develop some practical non-job related skills, like cooking, gardening, canning, and sewing, because I'd like to have a hobby that produces something useful. Cleaning or working on the house on the weekends can be really relaxing, especially because it has a tangible result. In research science, sometimes it takes years and years to get the results you're looking for, so it's a nice break to spend a weekend and be rewarded with a freshly painted room, or a few jars of fresh tomato sauce to store for the winter.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Stick with it! Find joy in what you do, whether it's in mastering new things, solving complicated problems, exploring the Universe, or anything else.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><b>Read More:</b><br />\r\n*<a href='http://messenger.jhuapl.edu/' target='_blank'>The Messenger Mission Website</a><br />\r\n*<a href='http://dawn.jpl.nasa.gov/' target='_blank'>The Dawn Mission Website</a><br />\r\n*<a href='http://moonmineralogymapper.jpl.nasa.gov/' target='_blank'>Moon Mineralogy Mapper Website</a><br />\r\n*<a href='http://womeninplanetaryscience.wordpress.com/' target='_blank'>Women in Planetary Science Website (WIPS)</a><br />\r\n*<a href='http://womeninplanetaryscience.wordpress.com/2010/07/30/rachel-klima-having-your-own-funding-opens-a-lot-of-doors/' target='_blank'>WIPS Article: \"Rachel Klima: Having your own funding opens a lot of doors\"</a><br />\r\n*<a href='http://dawn.jpl.nasa.gov/team/interviews/interview_r_klima.asp' target='_blank'>Rachel's Dawn Team Interview</a></p>\r\n",

In middle school, my friends and I would write to NASA, the <a href='http://www.nasa.gov/centers/marshall/home/index.html' target='_blank'>Marshall Spaceflight Center</a> (MSFC), the <a href='http://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/home/index.html' target='_blank'>Johnson Space Center</a> (JSC), and the <a href='http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/' target='_blank'>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</a> (JPL), requesting the latest pictures, booklets and information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, in seventh grade I had a student teacher in science, who introduced me to the work of Dr. Robert H. Goddard. I was fascinated and corresponded with Mrs. Goddard for the next 10 years. Upon finishing my Master of Science degree, I received a job offer from JPL and I have been with NASA ever since.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Early on I was inspired by the astronauts and by watching space mission reports on television. I was inspired by the work of Dr. Robert H. Goddard and read several books about his developments. I believe my mother excited me too, because when the early Mercury missions were being conducted I remember coming home from school and her telling me all about the coverage on these missions that she had seen on television.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is a Manager of a Materials and Processes Laboratory? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I am the manager of the Materials and Processes Laboratory at Marshall Space Flight Center where we work with and develop many materials to prepare for spaceflight. Everything is made up of different materials, whether they are metals, plastics, ceramics, polymers etc., and we must be sure that these materials meet all their required properties to hold up in the launch environment, the space environment and whatever conditions they are put in. Often this includes treatments that the materials must undergo to have the desired properties.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career. </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There have been lots of favorite moments, but one stands out. When the Tethered Satellite System was flown on the space shuttle, scientists were excited about the data it could produce. The satellite surface was painted for thermal control, and electrical conductivity. A specific type of paint was selected and already on the satellite when it was discovered that it lost its conductive ability after an extended time in vacuum. (Launch was only a couple of months away when this was determined.) And so in our labs we developed a new conductive coating with the right thermal properties and the process to apply it. The satellite skins were brought from <a href='http://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/home/index.html' target='_blank'>Kennedy Space Center</a> (KSC) to MSFC where they were stripped, the new coating applied and then it was sent back to KSC to be put back on the spacecraft. All this was done at a very fast pace but in time that the launch schedule was maintained. The new coating worked very well and even exceeded the scientists' expectations.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Study and work hard, but moreover find those things in science or engineering that excite you and that you want to spend a lot of time studying just because it's intriguing and rewarding to you. Having a college degree in a field such as physics, chemistry or engineering -- particularly mechanical engineering, chemical engineering or materials engineering -- can lead you to aspects of this work.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I am an amateur (Ham) radio operator, a hunter, a fisherman, and a traveler. (It is great to see and experience new places.) I also like to facet gems from rough material into finished gemstones, and play the banjo for fun.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Find those things that are your passion and pursue them. Get involved in reading, and online research. Talk to people who are in the fields that may be of interest to you in order to learn more about them. And join astronomy clubs, student chapters of professional organizations and other groups for some key peer interaction. Of course, it's important to do well in the developing the tools you'll need in your field, such as math, science, computer skills, and even writing.</p>\r\n",

But one thing I knew for sure: I wanted to be a person who serves others in a way that makes an everlasting and positive impact.\"\n</div>\n<footer>\n<cite>- Rania Ghatas</cite>\n</footer>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin'></div>\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Describe the first time you made a personal connection with outer space.</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It was hard to not fall in love with space growing up on the Space Coast next to Kennedy Space Center. Watching Space Shuttle launches on TV and sometimes seeing a launch in person was wonderful and even magical&mdash;especially when hearing the sonic boom when the shuttles re-entered Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. However, I would say my personal connection with outer space all started when I was about five years old, all thanks to my older brother&rsquo;s love of space and flying. Growing up, I would always watch Star Trek with him (mainly because he had the remote), but I fell in love with the show and with space. Then, when I was about eight years old, we watched the movie Apollo 13 and the allure of working for NASA someday was set into motion.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>How did you end up working in the space program?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As a child, I was always very curious and eager to learn new things and explore my surroundings. As the years passed, that curiosity and eagerness never subsided; it only increased with each passing year. As a result, I had a hard time pinpointing just one path&mdash;I wanted to pursue everything and anything. But one thing I knew for sure: I wanted to be a person who serves others in a way that makes an everlasting and positive impact. It was the &ldquo;how&rdquo; that always got me. During undergrad, I studied everything from pre-med to law, and my childhood dream of working for NASA got lost in the midst of pursuing &ldquo;everything else.&rdquo; But then I discovered a course on Human Factors Psychology during my last semester of undergraduate studies. While researching graduate degree programs, I found a Master of Science program at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University (ERAU) that focused on Human Factors and Systems Engineering. There, I was given the opportunity to work on the Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) in the National Airspace System project (NAS) with the FAA through ERAU&rsquo;s Next-Generation Advanced Research Lab. My experience with that project exactly matched an opening at Langley for a Human Factors Researcher to work on NASA&rsquo;s UAS in the NAS project, which I immediately applied for. After completing my education at ERAU in 2011, my dreams of being a NASA researcher and helping make a difference became a reality when I started my NASA career in July of 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is a Human Factors/Machine Systems Research Engineer?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A Human Factors/machine Systems Research Engineer is someone who applies a set of information or physical and psychological characteristics to the design of devices and systems for human use. Human Factors encompasses a collection of data and principles regarding human characteristics, capabilities and limitations, and applies it to the design of machines, machine systems, work methods, and environments.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='center image_module' style=''>\n<figure class='inline_figure'>\n<img src='/images/content/Seattle_835.png'>\n<figcaption>\nA Human Factors/machine Systems Research Engineer is someone who applies a set of information or physical and psychological characteristics to the design of devices and systems for human use. \n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career.</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This question is definitely a hard one to answer. I have too many favorite moments in the five years I have worked at Langley to pick from. If I had to pick just one, I would say being selected to represent Langley Research Center at the Society of Women Engineers Conference in 2016 and participating on a panel session about how NASA empowers women in engineering. Sitting in front of the many young engineers who were excited to learn about what it is like to be a woman engineer at NASA was exciting. Meeting other women engineers from across NASA centers and interacting with each of them was an honor. Before the session started and everyone was settling into their seats, I remembered what it was like to be one of those young engineers who was so excited to hear anything about NASA and, at that moment, I was the one sitting on the other side speaking about NASA to the next generation. It was a humbling experience and a moment that I will treasure.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My mother and older brother have instilled so much inspiration in me throughout my whole life! Their endless encouragement and support has always been, and continues to be, my motivation and inspiration in both my personal life and my career. They, along with my husband now, inspire me each and every day to be the best I can be and to follow my dreams. I am forever indebted to all their love and support, along with my father who I know is watching over me. They brought me to where I am today and where I aspire to be in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I would say go for it! I have taken a non-traditional path and it led me to where I am now. I have always enjoyed learning new things and my interests are as wide as the ocean. I wanted to be so many things growing up, from a figure skater to an aerospace engineer, to a medical doctor and lawyer, and everything else in between. My advice would be to study, learn, and experience as much as you can. If you feel like something is not working for you, don&rsquo;t worry about it; find something else that sparks your interest until you find that one spark that you don&rsquo;t want to let go of. Surround yourself with people who love and support you and have your best interests at heart. Your passion and drive can and will take you places that exceed your wildest dreams.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I love traveling and exploring new places and creating memories with family and friends! My favorite part about traveling is immersing myself in the culture of whichever country or state I&rsquo;m visiting&mdash;and especially trying new food. Traveling helps broaden our horizons and allows us to experience the world in its purest form. It gives me great appreciation for God&rsquo;s wonders. In addition to traveling, I also love photography and designing handmade crafts.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My advice would be to pursue what makes you happy, to follow your dreams, and to never give up. Life is meant to be lived and pursuing a career that will make you happy is an essential part of enjoying life. Be who you are and dream big!</p>\r\n",

I attended college in Berkeley, California and grad school in San Diego, California, so I consider myself to be a transplanted Californian.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin clearfix'></div>\n<div class='quote'>\n\"Try not to stay too focused on one specific goal - keep an open mind and follow whatever interests you.

My LEGOS and chemistry sets fueled my desire to be a scientist. I loved \"Star Trek\" and \"Mr. Wizard,\" and most other related TV programs and movies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The summer after we moved to California, my mom arranged for me to attend a space camp -- the Pacific Rim Spaceflight Academy located in Portland, Oregon (part of the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry). I had a blast and loved all the activities -- we did positive and negative G flights in a four-person airplane, underwater weightless activities, built and launched model rockets, and we even did a mock Gemini mission. From that point on I was pretty hooked on space and solar system exploration. Space camp was probably the biggest influence on my college career, which ultimately led me to NASA.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>How did you end up working in the space program? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In college I majored in physics, with an emphasis on geophysics. I found planetary science fascinating and so I decided to apply to graduate school in geophysics. For a literature review project, I read about the controversial <i>Nemesis</i> theory which explains the observed periodicity in mass extinctions on Earth. These types of studies really motivated my desire to get into geophysics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was accepted to the geophysics program at the University of California, San Diego's (UCSD) Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO). After a year of course work, during which I did a couple of research cruises related to ocean-bottom seismology, a professor in my department mentioned a project that involved analyzing seismic data from the Apollo Moon missions. I was immediately intrigued, and ultimately wrote my Ph.D. thesis centered on this topic. It is my work with the Apollo seismic data that led me to two post-docs: one with the French space agency, and one with the astrogeology team at the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). These positions provided me with the qualifications I needed to work with NASA.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I have been inspired by my primary graduate student advisor, Catherine Johnson. Catherine was and continues to be a huge inspiration for me for everything, from her level-headedness to her time management skills. She has been a great role model and an even greater friend.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is a Planetary Scientist? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A planetary scientist wears many hats. Everything from active mission guidance to past mission data analysis is fair game. It's also common to undertake theoretical modeling of planetary processes: from the space environment to the atmosphere, to the crust, to the core of a planet, moon or other solar system body.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career. </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Living abroad in Paris for a year, for my post-doctoral position with the French space agency, was among the top highlights of my career so far.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Try not to stay too focused on one specific goal -- keep an open mind and follow whatever interests you. You may discover a related field that's a better fit, or a great group of people you can't imagine working without.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In my spare time I enjoy my hobbies of sewing, cooking and biking. I also spend lots of time reading and playing with my two sons. My eldest loves to read about the solar system and the space shuttle program!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Same advice my mom always gave me -- keep taking math classes! See if your school or college has a science or math club, and join it. In college, I was in the Society for Physics Students and we did a lot of fun activities and tours, including a tour of the wind tunnel at <a href='http://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/home/#.VNFq4GjF98E' target='_blank'>NASA-Ames Research Center (ARC)</a>.

To read the full interview, click <a href='http://womeninplanetaryscience.wordpress.com/2011/04/25/dr-renu-malhotra/' target='_blank'>here</a>.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Where are you from? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>India. I was born in New Delhi. I grew up mostly in Hyderabad, which is on the Deccan Plateau and near the geometrical center of the Indian sub-continent. It is in a semi-arid climate zone, surprisingly similar to the high desert region of the southwestern U.S., which is where I live now.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin clearfix'></div>\n<div class='quote'>\n\"If you recognize an anomaly in your area, dig into it. More often than not, you'll find something interesting.\"\n</div>\n<footer>\n<cite>- Renu Malhotra</cite>\n</footer>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin'></div>\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Describe the first time you made a personal connection with outer space. </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I remember that it was during the summer of 1969 when I was eight-years old. I was jumping rope outside, and a neighbor's radio was blaring loudly in the background. Suddenly, the pop music was interrupted with a news bulletin about the Apollo 11 lunar landing. I remember freezing with my rope, abandoning my playmates and then climbing up to the neighbor's window in order to hear all the details of the news. I held my breath throughout the entire news bulletin, but inside my head I couldn't stop saying, \"Wow! Wow!\"</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>How did you end up working in the space program? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>By high school I had decided that I wanted to devote my life to \"understanding how nature works.\" I had an affinity for math and I studied physics in college (in India). I then went to Cornell University for graduate studies in physics. I had long wanted to come to the United States due to its reputation for higher education, but also because American culture embraces the values of freedom. India was not a free country (from my point of view). So, the idea of being free in the freest country on Earth was a big dream for me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My first summer at Cornell, I worked on a project in non-linear dynamics and chaos theory. I became very interested in this field. However my advisor Mitchell Feigenbaum, left Cornell shortly thereafter. I needed a new advisor, so, I contacted several professors in the astronomy department who were studying planetary dynamics (which is the preeminent non-linear dynamical system!), and found an advisor there: Stanley Dermott.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With Stan as an advisor, I worked on the Uranian satellites (a rather current topic at the time in the wake of the Voyager 2 flyby of Uranus in 1986). The first problem Stan suggested to me was the anomalous motion of one of Uranus's moons named Miranda. Within a few weeks, I came up with an answer of what was going on with Miranda's orbit. I hardly knew anything about orbits at that time -- for me it was all about knowing the equations and getting a feel for where the anomaly was coming from. I received some attention from wise people in planetary science by solving that problem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I found that I loved working with equations of orbital mechanics. This was a whole new world, and I felt like I belonged in it.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is a Professor of Planetary Sciences at the University of Arizona? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My job is a mix of teaching, research and service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Teaching includes formal lecture classes, as well as informal advising of undergraduate and graduate students. My research is how I carry on my curiosity-driven calling, \"understanding how nature works,\" in the particular discipline of planetary dynamics. I often work with graduate students in some of my research projects. This helps me to pass on my knowledge and to train the next generation of scientists. Such students earn a Ph.D. degree when they complete a significant research project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The \"service\" part of my job description involves several different types of activities at several different levels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Service to my university and department is in the form of participation in the self-governance of the university. For example, I serve on the Ph.D. examination committees for my own, as well as other departments and on committees that make faculty-hiring and promotion decisions. Currently, I am also serving as director of an inter-disciplinary program in theoretical astrophysics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Service to my scientific community consists of providing evaluations of scientists for prospective employment or for promotions, reviewing scientific papers and research proposals, evaluating academic programs for accreditation agencies, organizing scientific conferences, and providing advice to science-policy makers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Service to the public consists of writing about my science for non-specialists, giving presentations of my research to public audiences, organizing science activities for K-12 students and teachers, and answering queries from journalists.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career.</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>One fine day in the spring of 2004, after many months of attempts, I finally persuaded a senior colleague in my department with my theoretical interpretation of his data on impact craters that he had collected over a 35-year career. The joy of successfully communicating my idea to him was incomparable. We later wrote a paper together on an important part of the planets' meteoritic bombardment history.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My father inspired in me an abiding curiosity about the physical world and how things work. Mitchell Feigenbaum sparked my interest in non-linear dynamics. Stanley Dermott and Peter Goldreich inspired my interest in planetary dynamics.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Work hard and acquire command of the technical parts of your scientific subfield so it does not hamper your exploration of the edges of knowledge. Then pick important problems -- there are interesting and important problems everywhere. You just have to be open to them. If you recognize an anomaly in your area, dig into it. More often than not, you'll find something interesting. For me, one such problem was Pluto. That was a peculiar planet, now called a dwarf planet. It didn't fit in. I don't know if anyone recognized it back then as a major issue, but it bothered me -- it felt like grit in my mind. It led me to a pivotal discovery for solar system science -- the idea that the planets migrated from their birthplaces.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I enjoy vegetable gardening in a community garden in my neighborhood. I also like to play Sudoku and watch movies.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Find an area that appeals to you. Find good mentors and a peer group in which you can learn together. Have fun with the subject.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><b>Read More: </b><br />\r\n*<a href='http://womeninplanetaryscience.wordpress.com/2011/04/25/dr-renu-malhotra/' target='_blank'>Post on Renu on the Women in Planetary Science Website</a><br />\r\n*<a href='http://www.lpl.arizona.edu/~renu/' target='_blank'>Renu's University of Arizona Faculty Page</a><br />\r\n*<a href='http://www.astronomy.com/Magazine%20Issues/2011/June%202011.aspx' target='_blank'>Renu is Featured in \"Astro Confidential\" in \"Astronomy Magazine\" (June 2011)</a><br />\r\n*<a href=' http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2013/07/125-solar-system/irion-text' target='_blank'>National Geographic (July 2013) Feature with Renu</a></p>\r\n",

I soaked up every moment I could of all the TV broadcasts and news. Apollo really hooked me on space for life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also -- like a lot of kids in those days -- I owned a telescope. I remember viewing the <a href='PLANET:Moon' target='_blank'>moon</a> during the Apollo years: Viewing the moon when humans were walking on it -- awesome! -- I wish kids could do that today.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>How did you end up working in the space program? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It's been a long, weird trip. In college I thought astrophysics was cool, so I pursued that for my bachelor's degree (you could say that I'm half-astrophysicist). However, when I was heading to graduate school I became interested in planetary exploration -- planetary science was really exploding around that time. I therefore went to UCLA for graduate work and had the great fortune of working with <a href='Person:RussellC' target='_blank'>Christopher Russell</a> on <a href='missions/profile.cfm?Sort=Alpha&amp;Letter=P&amp;Alias=Pioneer%2012' target='_blank'>Pioneer Venus</a>, an <a href='http://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/home/index.html#.Ug6hdZLvt8E' target='_blank'>Ames Research Center</a> (ARC) planetary mission. Working on this mission and with Chris was such a blast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After receiving my Ph.D. in Geophysics and Space Physics, I worked on other missions, mostly in the area of space-physics research. However, it was during this time period that new missions were slow in coming, so a friend of mine persuaded me to go to the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), where they were working on instruments for Department of Defense (DOD) missions, as well as NASA flight opportunities. Working with the DOD opened the door to an entirely different culture and society of really smart, talented, capable people who wore Air Force uniforms; the way you do business there is a lot different than within the civil space-science sector! It was a great experience!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Later at Los Alamos, a huge opportunity opened up when (more good fortune) Bill Feldman generously invited me to participate in NASA's Lunar Prospector mission (another Ames mission!). It was a spectacular success and I got hooked on using neutrons and gamma rays to see what makes up the moon and the planets. This kind of orbital remote geochemistry is relatively new: In 1998, Lunar Prospector provided the first global neutron and gamma ray maps of the moon. These measurements brought a whole new slant on how the moon formed and how it has evolved over the past 4.5 billion years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shortly afterward Bill also involved me in the 2001 Mars Odyssey mission, working with another neutron spectrometer. This effort led to maps of water abundance on the surface of <a href='PLANET:Mars' target='_blank'>Mars</a>, which showed that water ice is far more abundant at the poles than previously thought. Mars Odyssey also revealed extensive provinces where hydrous minerals, salts and clays may have been deposited earlier in Mars' history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I left Los Alamos to join NASA Ames, as the Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE) mission was getting started in 2008. It has been exciting to have the opportunity to lead the science effort on LADEE, a mission aimed at answering questions that go back to the Apollo era -- right back where I first became hooked on space. \"The circle is now complete.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My brother Lance: He was always interested in science and astronomy. Lance ended up in geology, which at the time I regarded as a little bit \"pedestrian,\" considering there were things like black holes and quasars and all that stuff out there in the cosmos, plus the wonder of the planets -- like Jupiter and the icy moons of our solar system. But now -- today -- I can't get enough of geology; it fascinates me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My graduate advisor, Chris Russell, was an inspiration too. Chris was also generous with opportunities to be involved in space instruments, such as magnetometers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bill Feldman at Los Alamos is a physicist with an amazing depth of knowledge, but at the same time has old-school courtesy, honor and integrity, as well as being incredibly generous. He loved getting younger scientists involved in the stuff that he was interested in. He's still going strong today, and continuing his Mars research. I'm deeply indebted to Bill -- I am still learning from him.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is a Project Scientist? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A project scientist's job is basically to look out for the science interests of a mission, and to make sure that its objectives are met. Sometimes engineering needs, or subsystem requirements, can throw a wrench into the science works and vice versa. A project scientist works out how to make everyone, if not exactly happy, at least agreeable to a solution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a way, a project scientist has to straddle the engineering/science fence: knowing when engineering is being too literal in its interpretations of the mission requirements (science is infamously squishy, when it comes to requirements) and adjudicating science team requests that may just not be feasible within the scope and design of the mission. A project scientist has to \"get\" both what the science team is really after, and the capabilities and limits that engineering places on the mission.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career. </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I have lots of favorites! Watching a launch, getting telemetry that says the spacecraft is safely in orbit, seeing the first products of data acquired by your instrument ... etc. I plan to have a favorite moment when LADEE achieves lunar orbit! That will definitely be a cool event.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If you want to do space instrumentation, take courses in engineering as well as science. If you want to understand how the <a href='planets/index.cfm' target='_blank'>planets</a> were formed and the processes that go on there, take courses in geology and planetary science. I didn't do those things, which is why I strongly suggest them!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I enjoy the California coast. There's nothing like hiking the hills above the sea, or just being still and watching the waves. Oh, and sushi! Yum!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, first I'd ask them to close their eyes and picture what they'd really enjoy doing in 10 years. What did they see, and do they see themselves doing it as a career? I would also ask if they are interested in building things, or are interested in the more theoretical aspects of science. I would suggest that where they feel drawn, in that spectrum of possibilities, is where they ought to go. And that, in turn, helps to figure out which schools to go to, what classes to take and so on. Just common sense, I guess.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><b>Read More:</b><br />\r\n*<a href='http://moon.nasa.gov/missionsFeed.cfm?Sort=Target&amp;Target=Moon&amp;MCode=LADEE' target='_blank'>LADEE Mission Page</a><br />\r\n*<a href='http://moon.nasa.gov/home.cfm' target='_blank'>NASA's Moon Site</a><br />\r\n*<a href='http://moon.nasa.gov/ladeelaunch.cfm' target='_blank'>LADEE Launch Page</a><br />\r\n*<a href='http://moon.nasa.gov/moontoolkit.cfm' target='_blank'>New Moon Toolkit</a><br />\r\n*<a href='http://www.lunar.lanl.gov/pages/elphic.html' target='_blank'>Los Alamos National Laboratory Page on Richard</a></p>\r\n",

I didn't get very satisfactory answers, but this was pre-Sputnik, so space flight hadn't yet come to be a common topic in high school physics. However, I think it was these discussions that piqued my interest in orbital mechanics, even though it was to be a few more years before I felt that I understood the topic.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin clearfix'></div>\n<div class='quote'>\nOne of the most important things you learn in college is how to learn, although you likely won't realize it at the time.\n</div>\n<footer>\n<cite>- Robert Mitchell</cite>\n</footer>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin'></div>\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>How did you end up working in the space program?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>When I first got out of college, I wound up going to work for a defense contractor near Dallas, Texas, but they didn't have many contracts at the time. (They mostly needed warm bodies with college degrees to enable successful bidding on more contracts.) This was around the time that the <a href='http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/' target='_blank'>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</a> (JPL) was flying the Ranger missions to the Moon. The Ranger missions looked a lot more exciting to me than what I was doing at the time, and so I sent my resume off to JPL, they made me an offer, and I've been here ever since.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The sleepy little farming town of Springville was fortunate to have some very capable and dedicated teachers in its school, and that's where I was initially inspired to do well in math and science. Perhaps the person most significant for me was my math teacher, Ms. Brown. Ms. Brown and I got along well, even though she wasn't very popular with most of the other students because she made us behave and work hard. But she knew the material well, and she was very good at making it challenging rather than tedious. I credit her with making math interesting and rewarding for me and for giving me a good foundation for my subsequent studies in science and engineering.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is a Cassini Program Manager?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My job was to be responsible for the overall implementation of the operations phase of the Cassini mission. This included negotiating the budget with NASA Headquarters, managing the allocation of the money internal to the project and ensuring that all of the activities required to keep Cassini operating were completed properly and on schedule. The Cassini project team is staffed with a very capable and competent group of scientists and engineers, and they made my job easy!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career.</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Being told that I was the selected candidate to be the Cassini Program Manager was obviously a big moment. But another moment that occurred many years earlier left an even bigger impression on my memory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was the lead of the Trajectory and Maneuver team for the Viking mission to Mars in the mid-70s. This was the first time that NASA had attempted to land a spacecraft on another planet, and it seemed to me to be a very risky endeavor. Of course, NASA had completed the Surveyor and Apollo programs on the moon prior to this, but Mars just seemed different with its greater gravity, its atmosphere and its poorly characterized surface, at least to the resolution that mattered to a vehicle landing and staying right side up. The first Viking lander had been programmed to take an image of one of its own landing pads immediately upon touchdown, and a group of us were standing around a monitor waiting for that image to come down. The image finally began to appear on the screen, slowly, and line by line in real-time as each line exposure was taken: first a grayish blur, and then a very clear beginning of the edge of the landing pad sitting on the soil, later building to show the whole pad and leg sitting on Mars. That's probably the single moment in my career that I will remember the longest.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I have a rather large lot at home and I enjoy gardening in it. I also enjoy hiking, and I have gotten involved in restoring antique motorcycles.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Go for it! Give it your very best effort. It will pay big dividends when the time comes to start building a career. But don't hesitate to change your direction if you find new areas of interest as you mature and your education progresses.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><b>Read More:</b><br />\r\n*<a href='http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/index.cfm' target='_blank'>Cassini Homepage</a></p>\r\n",

(on Long Island), in the eastern suburbs of New York City.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Describe the first time you made a personal connection with outer space.</b><br />\r\nThe moon landings had a big influence on me, of course. As a child I was glued to the television set for each launch, landing and splashdown of the Apollo astronauts. Also, my dad would take the family on visits to the Hayden Planetarium in New York City. It was a magical place for me. Especially spectacular were the landscape paintings lit with black light and the gigantic ceiling orrery. With this inspiration, I would hang my own homemade models of the planets from my bedroom ceiling. The moons were made of crumpled masking tape on top of toothpicks, which were stuck into the sides of Styrofoam ball planets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1970, my whole family drove down to Virginia to see a solar eclipse -- without me. They left me with my grandparents! (I was 5 years old at the time.) So I showed them by becoming the astronomer in the family. My dad ultimately did make it up to me by sending me to the 1991 solar eclipse in Hawaii. It was mesmerizing and spectacular, like the sun suddenly being replaced by a hole in the sky.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin clearfix'></div>\n<div class='quote'>\n\"The most exciting moments are the 'aha moments' when a scientific problem that you've been wrestling with suddenly falls into place and begins to make sense.\"\n</div>\n<footer>\n<cite>- Bob Pappalardo</cite>\n</footer>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin'></div>\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p><b>How did you end up working in the space program?</b><br />\r\nIn college at Cornell University, I knew that I wanted to do something related to astronomy, but it was only once I was in college for a couple of years did I realize that there was a field known as planetary geology, which combines planetary science and geology. I learned about it because Carl Sagan was teaching a graduate seminar on the topic, and fortunately he let me sit in on this class. I became interested in icy moon geology through a course taught by Professor Joe Veverka, in which I did a final paper on Ganymede's grooved terrain. This paper was largely based on the work of Professor Veverka's then newly graduated Ph.D. student, Steve Squyres, who now leads the Mars missions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For graduate school I went to Arizona State University in order to work with Professor Ron Greeley, who was a member of the Galileo imaging team. My thesis work there was on the origin of ridges and grooves on icy satellites, focusing on the geology of the uranian satellite Miranda.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The timing for the finish of my graduate work was fortunate, as planning for the Galileo spacecraft's upcoming satellite encounters were just beginning. I worked with Professor Greeley on the initial plans for Galileo's imaging of Jupiter's moon Europa. I then moved on to Brown University as a post-doctoral researcher working with Professor Jim Head, also a member of the Galileo imaging team. At Brown I helped to plan all of the imaging observations for the Ganymede encounters by Galileo from G1 (in 1996) through G29 (in 2000).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I went on to become a faculty member at the University of Colorado in Boulder for about 5 years. Teaching was fun and inspirational, but I couldn't pass up the offer to come to the <a href='http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/' target='_blank'>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</a> (JPL) in Pasadena, Calif. to help push along the planning for the next planned mission to Europa.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<b>Who inspired you?</b><br />\r\nScientifically, it was Carl Sagan, of course. I knew of Sagan through his coverage of the Viking landings on Mars, his appearances on \"The Johnny Carson Show,\" and then through his television series \"Cosmos\" and his outstanding books. I investigated Cornell University as a possible college to attend because Sagan was a professor there. And because he was teaching a planetary geology course, I learned that there was such a field. I had the chance to audit two of his classes, and then to work on a research project under the tutelage of his post-doctoral researcher Reid Thompson. I wouldn't be doing what I am today without Sagan's influence, guidance, and encouragement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>What is a Project Scientist?</b><br />\r\nA Project Scientist is essentially the lead scientist for a spacecraft mission who is responsible for overseeing the scientific goals and quality of the mission. The Project Scientist speaks for the mission's science to NASA and to the public. He or she is key in organizing how the mission's science will be accomplished. I have been honored to serve as the Project Scientist for a portion of the Cassini mission at Saturn, and now for the planned Jupiter Europa Orbiter. This orbiter will help to address the mysteries of this moon, which is believed to hide a global subsurface ocean.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career.</b><br />\r\nThe most exciting moments are the \"aha moments\" when a scientific problem that you've been wrestling with suddenly falls into place and begins to make sense. These \"aha moments\" tend to come from a mix of hard work, intuition and perseverance. I have been fortunate to have had several such moments in my career, especially when talking through a problem with a colleague -- attacking a problem together from different perspectives and backgrounds can give rise to those key insights that one person wouldn't have thought of alone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On another front, recently I had the chance to talk with congressional staffers about the fascination of Europa, and about the planned Jupiter Europa Orbiter spacecraft. It was a wonderful opportunity to bring the excitement of planetary exploration to the halls of government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you?</b><br />\r\nFollow your heart and your dreams! I can't tell you how many times along the way I was warned of how few jobs there are in planetary science, and how difficult it can be to get one. Such words and advice can discourage those who are not fully dedicated, while those who persevere can attain one of those hard-to-get jobs. Follow your dreams, and if you are dedicated to your path, the opportunities will emerge.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='center image_module' style=''>\n<figure class='inline_figure'>\n<img alt='FILE:Explorer1_Pappalardo.jpg' src='/images/content/Explorer1_Pappalardo1_720.jpg'>\n<figcaption>\nHaving a little fun with the famous Explorer 1 photo.\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p><b>What do you do for fun?</b><br />\r\nContra dancing. It is related to square dancing, and similarly is conducted by a caller who instructs the dancing couples, who are positioned in long lines. It has history in English country dancing, but evolved in New England into a fast-paced group dance which resembles a living M.C. Escher drawing. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the past I've painted (oils and acrylics) and played guitar (I'm a folkie at heart), although more recently, work keeps me from doing this as much as I'd like. Occasionally, I'll bike-ride or play tennis. I live in Venice Beach and enjoy walking or biking along the boardwalk and beach there, especially at sunset. And watching my two very cute and amusing cats keeps me entertained at just about any time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them?</b><br />\r\nPay attention in class, and ask questions. Realize that the reason you're in class is not to memorize facts and equations; it's to learn how to think about problems, and how to solve them. If you don't understand the underlying reason for an equation or fact that you are tempted to memorize, ask your teacher about the bigger picture. Maybe this will make your teacher think differently about it, too.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Read More </b><br />\r\n*<a href='http://science.jpl.nasa.gov/people/Pappalardo' target='_blank'>Robert Pappalardo's Personal Web Site</a><br />\r\n*<a href='http://opfm.jpl.nasa.gov/europajupitersystemmissionejsm' target='_blank'>Europa Jupiter System Mission Web Site</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Links to Videos, Stories, etc.</b><br />\r\n*<a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9M3xtPuZkj0' target='_blank'>Presentation on EJSM</a><br />\r\n*<a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5pcJx_C2LY' target='_blank'>JPL von Karman Lecture: The Hidden Ocean of Europa</a><br />\r\n*<a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vAUMS6VtXo' target='_blank'>Video on Europa</a><br />\r\n*<a href='http://www.facebook.com/europa.moon' target='_blank'>Europa's Facebook Page</a></p>\r\n",

After some years on Whidbey Island, my brothers and I attended high school in the town of Burlington in the Skagit Valley.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin clearfix'></div>\n<div class='quote'>\n\"I always recommend that you should not worry about career advancement too soon.

In those times, there were still a lot of people who were struggling to grasp the idea that human-made things and humans themselves -- could visit outer space. Up until then, these ideas were in the exclusive domain of science fiction. The terms and ideas of this new frontier were as unheard of and foreign as rocket science itself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My most intimate contact with outer space came from the magazines \"National Geographic\" and \"Life.\" Although they arrived in the mail many months after the actual space-event really happened, I waited for them patiently and with keen interest. The magazines were loaded with crisp and colorful pictures, stories about rockets and the apparently super-human astronauts (they were super-human to me), as well as many images of real space travel. Later, Time Life came out with hardcover books about science that arrived monthly. Like the magazines, some had images and details about space travel (including the planets and the possibility of alien worlds). I would stare at the pages in these books, studying them for hours on rainy northwest Sunday afternoons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a child, I did imagine myself an inventor. I fancied that I could invent something that might make flying to outer space easier or even build a robot that would travel to other planets. I did spend many hours building little models of NASA rockets and space capsules. (Revell sold fantastic models). After gluing all the pieces together I would spend endless hours painting them. (For all the time I spent working on these models, I could have had a Ph.D. by now.)</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>How did you end up working in the space program?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>By luck, I found myself moving to a school that had close connections with unmanned space travel. I had just transferred from Whitman College in Walla Walla, Wash. to the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in Pasadena, Calif., where I continued majoring in math/physics and electrical engineering. During this time, excitement was rampant for the Voyager flybys of the gas giants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before arriving at Caltech, I had read about it -- and the <a href='http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/' target='_blank'>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</a> (JPL) -- in those very same Time Life books when I was 12. I was both daunted and thrilled by these places and their achievements. I had told myself there was no way that I was smart enough to go to Caltech or get close to what JPL did, yet here I was, at Caltech and only a few miles from JPL. (I had felt that way about Whitman too!)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While at Caltech, JPL's Voyager spacecraft began returning the fantastic images of Jupiter. Even the busy problem-solvers at Caltech would peek up from their work and smile in delight at the incoming images. It was a heady time to be an engineering student!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Later, JPL graciously offered me a part-time position as a draftsman of Galileo spacecraft schematics and I found myself inside the very images I had envied more than a decade earlier. After various positions at JPL, I began working on Mars Pathfinder (MPF). I have been working on Mars missions ever since.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Professionally, many people have influenced and inspired me -- including many of the people on this website!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Certainly, Walter Cronkite's gentle and persistently curious enthusiasm for space (as well as his guests) was a huge influence. Cronkite's style really resonated with me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The science fiction authors: Isaac Asimov, Arthur C. Clarke, Robert A. Heinlein, and Ray Bradbury inspired my curiosity for stuff \"out there\" and for a future that could be brighter than today. Many of my teachers were also very good at encouraging me to think beyond my own limits.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is a Systems Engineer?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I studied electrical engineering, math and physics in school, but I now call myself a \"systems engineer.\" As a systems engineer (or \"systems architect\" or sometimes titled \"chief engineer\"), I am asked to consider how complex systems and the people that build them can be put together to meet some well-defined mission objective. I specialize in autonomous interplanetary robotics.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career.</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I have been very lucky in that I have had more than one magical moment in my career. Some of my favorites have been on the terrifying side. My first big one of course was associated with the landing of Mars Pathfinder (MPF). I was chief engineer for MPF and leader of the entry, descent and landing (EDL) team. MPF was considered to be a \"under the radar\" mission; MPF had a very low budget for a Mars mission, especially when compared with the only other prior mission, the amazing Viking landers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MPF and her little payload named Sojourner were part of that now dubious and ill-defined \"Faster, Better, Cheaper\" mission development model. Ironically \"Faster, Better, Cheaper\" worked out pretty well for us, but there were at least two huge downsides: We had very little documentation to prove that everything was tested, and we had very little documentation to prove our design. We were also made up of a team of one-- there were not a lot of \"eyes\" on the test results. If someone made a mistake, there were only the testers, myself or one of my two EDL comrades (who worked the mechanical and dynamics analysis) to ascertain that mistake. The three of us had to keep our eyes peeled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fortunately, MPF was very testable and relatively simple. However, if anything bad had happened, a failure review board would have had a heyday! Fortunately, nothing bad did happen and Pathfinder made history in many ways.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As chief engineer and EDL leader, I knew Pathfinder like the back of my hand. I designed the sequence of events and worked with everyone who had to build and test the many systems that would land it on July 4, 1997. I have to admit that I felt a great load on my shoulders -- if it didn't work, I would have no one to blame but myself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the morning of July 4, 1997, we had prepared MPF to do all of the autonomous events that we had trained into it. All we had to do now was watch. About 15 minutes before landing we saw data flowing down that seemed to indicate that the onboard flight software we were running was the wrong version! We had loaded a newly debugged version just a month ago. Did we goof? I really did not want MPF to land with that version of the EDL software. Fortunately, we discovered that we had misinterpreted the telemetry -- the right version was indeed running.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Later that morning, my job was to narrate -- live and on camera -- the events as we observed them (the signals arrived in Spain about 11 minutes after they happened on Mars). Television cameras aimed at my face relayed my stress to viewers around the world. As the events unfolded one by one, the pace quickened and the quality of the signal that was beamed directly back to the 70-meter antenna in Madrid, Spain began to fade. Once the lander landed we were blind. Only my friends in Spain could actually see the signal on a spectrum analyzer at the station. \"I have all eyes watching,\" Sami Asmar reported in my headset. \"I see a weak signal coming in and out of the spectrum ...\" Knowing the timeline, I instantly knew that there was a radio signal beaming to Earth ... I beamed too. \"A signal is barely visible .... That is a good sign everybody!\" I said. I was on Mars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was fortunate enough to repeat these experiences by developing and landing the Mars Exploration Rovers (MER) Spirit and Opportunity. In many respects, those missions were harder and far more dramatic than MPF, as we had pushed the capability envelope of the Mars Pathfinder EDL design in order to get larger rovers to the surface. (Those landing nights were stressful too.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, I was chief engineer for Mars Science Laboratory (MSL). Although I did not lead the EDL team this time, I was very much involved in MSL's EDL systems and its rover Curiosity. I have to admit my sense of relief that MSL successfully landed on Mars matched or exceeded my relief in the successful landings of the other Mars rover missions. Curiosity is the crown of our achievements in exploring the surface of Mars and I have no doubt that it will inspire engineers and scientists for years to come.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I always recommend that you should not worry about career advancement too soon. Spend a decade in your career doing real work. Build something. Use your hands. Test it. Learn from your mistakes. Put yourself out there on the edge where you will force your eyes wide open.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, do not be afraid to appropriately move from one organization to another in order to broaden your experiences. I did this for nearly 15 years early in my career at JPL. For a long while I thought that I was slowing my career, and in a real sense I was: my salary seemed low. However, what really happened was that I had developed a wide base of skills and personal contacts. Many people came to feel that I was one of them, and when the opportunity came to do a systems job, I discovered that I had a lot of allies willing to root for me. My background allowed my career to explode.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Be patient, be curious and be willing to learn from the best.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>After all of this stress, I need to do something that takes my mind far from engineering. I play straight-ahead jazz trumpet, I paint and I love to ski. Viva la difference!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I tell them to focus on the basics. Math, physics first: computer science, mechanics, statistics and random variables come to mind. But do not forget to give your mind the gift of the humanities. Understanding human culture is not just convenient, it is at the heart of what we do as engineers and scientists. We are human first, robots last.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Read More:</b><br />\r\n*<a href='http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/' target='_blank'>Mars Exploration Program</a><br />\r\n*<a href='http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/programmissions/missions/past/pathfinder/' target='_blank'>Mars Pathfinder</a><br />\r\n*<a href='http://marsrover.nasa.gov/home/' target='_blank'>Mars Exploration Rovers</a><br />\r\n*<a href='http://marsprogram.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/' target='_blank'>Mars Science Laboratory</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Links to Videos, Stories, Etc.</b><br />\r\n*<a href='http://articles.latimes.com/2012/aug/04/science/la-sci-nasa-mars-curiosity-rover-gremlins-20120804' target='_blank'>LA Time News Article: \"Mars Engineer Did His Best to Trip Up Curiosity Rover\"</a><br />\r\n*<a href='http://www.universetoday.com/7024/the-mars-landing-approach-getting-large-payloads-to-the-surface-of-the-red-planet/' target='_blank'>Universe Today Article: \"The Mars Landing Approach: Getting Large Payloads to the Surface of the Red Planet\"</a><br />\r\n*<a href='http://www.nasa.gov/offices/oce/appel/ask/issues/43/43i_mwm_manning_schmidt.html' target='_blank'>Ask Magazine Article: \"From Masters with Masters: Rob Manning and Rudi Schmidt\"</a><br />\r\n*<a href='http://www.nasa.gov/offices/oce/appel/ask/issues/47/47s_sky_crane.html ' target='_blank'>Ask Magazine Article: \"The Sky Crane Solution\"</a><br />\r\n*<a href='http://askmagazine.nasa.gov/issues/33/33s_reboot_or_not_reboot.html' target='_blank'>Ask Article: \"Pathfinder's Mars Landing: To Reboot or Not Reboot\"</a><br />\r\n*<a href='http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/space/ultimate-mars-challenge.html' target='_blank'>NOVA: Ultimate Mars Challenge</a><br />\r\n*<a href='http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/video/index.cfm?id=694' target='_blank'>Guided Tour of Mars Phoenix Landing Video with Rob Manning Narrating</a></p>\r\n",

I didn't even know where Russia was, but I liked the idea of going into space. As I was growing up, I followed everything I could about the space program.

Then, years later, I saw my first volcano erupt, and that changed my mind forever. I was on Mount Etna in Sicily in July of 1979 when the volcano started erupting. The active crater had a beautiful fire fountain spurting red lava about 30 to 50 feet up into the air. It was the most beautiful spectacle, and I was hooked on volcanoes from then on. I studied Astronomy at the University of London, and got my doctorate in planetary science in 1986. I have been at the <a href='http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/' target='_blank'>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</a> (JPL) since 1989, when I worked on the Galileo mission, studying volcanoes on Jupiter's moon, Io. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now I continue to study volcanoes and also work on the Cassini mission on the RADAR team, analyzing data from Saturn's moon, Titan. </p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I guess [the first man in space] Yuri Gagarin inspired me first, followed by other astronauts and cosmonauts. Then during the Apollo 13 crisis, I read about a woman who worked for NASA, Frances Northcutt. She is not well known, but she showed me that women could work for NASA in science and engineering and help the space program.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is a Planetary Scientist? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As a planetary scientist, I currently plan science observations of Saturn, its moons and rings. My main interest on Cassini is Saturn's largest moon Titan. The Synthetic Aperture (SAR) data from the RADAR instrument show that Titan has volcanic features, but not like silicate volcanism on the Earth or Io. Titan's flows and other volcanic features are likely the result of ice volcanism.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Getting the Carl Sagan medal in 2005 for my public outreach efforts was the proudest moment of my career.

My parents and I would stay up late to watch it nearly every year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My parents are also very interested in geology -- wherever we went they would pick up rocks, or would stop to look at road cuts during car trips. I grew up surrounded by an interest in both space and in the planet we all live on.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>How did you end up working in the space program? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Very early on, I decided I wanted to work in planetary exploration. Growing up, I loved watching the show <i>NOVA</i> on PBS, and was particularly interested in any episode concerning spacecraft and the team of scientists and engineers running the spacecraft.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I also worked for two summers as a high school intern for the camera team for the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR) spacecraft. The team took me to see the spacecraft launch. After that experience, I knew I wanted to make a career of working with spacecraft.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I got a Bachelor of Science in planetary science from the California Institute of Technology, and a M.S. and Ph.D. in planetary geology from Brown University. I came to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) as a research postdoc with the intention of getting a job in spacecraft science operations. I'm very pleased that my plan worked out.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My family. My great-grandparents came to the United States with no money and without any knowledge of the English language.

My particular interest focuses on the polar deposits of Mars, which are several kilometer-thick deposits of water ice and dust layers. We think they contain the record of recent climate change on Mars (where \"recent\" means tens of years, to hundreds of millions of years). We are working on reading that record.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A science systems engineer is a representative for the science team who is embedded in the engineering team for a spacecraft. We act as a bridge to bring science and engineering together, and make sure that as engineering decisions are made; they are made in such a way that will allow us to accomplish as much science as possible within the constraints of the project. In essence, we work to ensure the biggest scientific bang for the engineering buck.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career. </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Landing night for the Curiosity rover was incredible. That night, and the days surrounding it, was full of a lot of excitement and very little sleep. As the science operations systems engineer for the mission, I sat with the science team in a basement watching the feed from the control room -- emotions were running VERY high.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the successful landing, the science team began their first sol of real planning. After spending time working with them to get our planning procedures and tools all set, it was a great experience to see them put it all into action for real.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And then to top it all off, I got to do the press conference for the image of the rover's parachute landing since I am also the HiRISE (High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment) investigation scientist.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Be curious about everything -- take every opportunity that presents itself to learn new things.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I play trombone, do bead work, knit, and read (especially speculative fiction and mysteries). I do a lot of public outreach; I love going out and sharing the exciting things that NASA does with the public. I'm also a mom, so lately my free time has been filled with playing with trains.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Learn how to communicate effectively to a variety of audiences, both in writing and giving presentations.

There was a full moon that night and when I looked down at my hands I could see the grains sparkling as the moonlight reflected off of them. I kept looking up at the Moon and down at my hands, and up and down again, and I was just awestruck at the thought that those tiny grains actually came from the moon, and that people had gone up there and brought some of it home so I could study it. Ever since that night when I look up at the moon it looks different to me, not just something that hangs in the sky, but a real place made of real rocks and dirt.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin clearfix'></div>\n<div class='quote'>\n\"Find an internship. I started my NASA career as an intern. It is a great way to get some hands-on experience with research, and it's a great way to start building your professional network.\"\n</div>\n<footer>\n<cite>- Sarah Noble</cite>\n</footer>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin'></div>\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>How did you end up working in the space program?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I decided when I was 10 that I wanted to be an astronaut. When I got to college, the only major with \"space\" in it was aerospace engineering. So, I went for that. I spent about a year at the University of Minnesota as an engineering major, when I realized I was not an engineer. So, I started looking through the course catalog thinking, \"What else can I be?\" I ran into geology and it looked interesting. So, I switched majors without ever having taken a geology class.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two years later, when I was a junior, one of my professors who knew I was a space buff pulled me aside and told me, \"You know, Sarah, there's this whole field of geology called planetary geology where you get to study the geology of other planets.\" (My professor had been involved with lunar sample studies since the early days of Apollo and he arranged for our class to get to see some real lunar rocks, which instantly had me hooked.) After that, he kept feeding me information about internships and other opportunities, which is how I ended up with a summer internship at the Lunar and Planetary Institute (LPI) with Gary Lofgren.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Carle Pieters, who was my Ph.D. advisor. Pieters has been a great role model for me. She has been there and done that, and was doing it back when she was the only woman in the room. So, it was really comforting to me as a young graduate student to see that you can have that kind of career, be successful and be respected in the community.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs an advisor, she was -- I always say she would give you \"almost\" enough rope to hang yourself. She was very sort of hands off, but she was always there. If you asked her to help, she was right there to help you, and her door was always open -- she would drop whatever she was doing the moment you walked in and give you her full attention. She gave you the chance to be independent and figure things out on your own, and then had her little safety net in case you couldn't figure it out. So, it was sort of perfect. That was exactly what I needed in an advisor.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is a Planetary Geologist?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A planetary geologist is someone who studies how other planets (and moons and asteroids and comets and whatever else is floating out there) form and evolve over time. We use what we have learned about how the Earth works to try to understand how other bodies work. Like other geologists, we may study volcanoes and rivers and glaciers and rocks and mountains, but also impacts and interactions with the solar wind and magma oceans and other processes that we don't see, or rarely see, here on the Earth. We often have to make do with much less data than terrestrial geologists -- we generally can't just go out to our field site and make measurements, or pick up rocks and bring them back to the lab -- we have to rely largely on remote data. I'm one of the lucky few because I study the Moon, and we do have samples -- at least from a couple of places. I study how soil forms on the Moon. By using the Apollo samples to understand that process, we can extrapolate to help us understand how soil might form on Mercury or an asteroid, places where similar processes should happen, but from where we don't have samples yet.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career.</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The best moments for me are those times when you figure something out, when that data you've been staring at for weeks -- or months -- suddenly makes sense. I don't mean the kind of big science breakthroughs that win Nobel prizes or put you on the cover of Science or Nature (those don't happen very often). Science mostly happens in small increments. But when those small victories happen, I think about how I just figured something out that in the entire history of mankind no one else has ever figured out before. How awesome is that?</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I have had a lot of great opportunities already in my career, and when I think back to how I became involved in many of those projects or got offered those positions, it was mostly because I knew people: from interacting at conferences or workshops, or from an internship or research collaboration. When an opportunity appeared, someone thought of me. So, network, network, network. The old adage about how \"it's not what you know, it's who you know\" can be applied to science as well as anywhere.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In my free time I like to paint.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Find an internship. I started my NASA career as an intern. It is a great way to get some hands-on experience with research, and it's a great way to start building your professional network.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><b>Read More:</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>*<a href='http://womeninplanetaryscience.wordpress.com/2011/02/10/sarah-noble-and-the-congressional-science-fellowship/' target='_blank'>Women in Planetary Science article on Sarah Noble</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Links to Videos, Stories, Etc.</b><br />\r\n*<a href='http://www.geosociety.org/csf/hof/noble.htm' target='_blank'>Geological Society of America (GSA) articles from when Sarah worked for Congress</a><br />\r\n*<a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgOM0_ALsw8' target='_blank'>The Goddard Space Flight Center's (GSFC) YouTube piece on DesertRATS, which includes Sarah Noble</a><br />\r\n*Follow Sarah on Twitter: @intrplnetsarah</p>\r\n",

To read the full original interview, click <a href='http://womeninplanetaryscience.wordpress.com/2010/05/11/women-in-planetary-science-meet-sally-dodson-robinson/' target='_blank'>here</a>.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Where are you from?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I was born in Los Angeles, Calif., but I have lived in many different places. I usually say I'm from California since I spent more of my childhood there than any other place.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Describe the first time you made a personal connection with outer space.</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I almost can't remember a time when I wasn't interested in space science. When I was seven or eight years old, I joined the Planetary Society and I collected the mini-posters of planets and moons that came with the magazine. Then my dad went on a business trip to Washington, D.C., and brought back a Voyager 2 poster book he picked up at the Air and Space Museum. I spent almost all of my spare time poring over that book and memorizing the planet and moon facts on the back of each photo. In fact, I used to quiz my family at the dinner table with such questions as which moon was the biggest in the solar system (Jupiter's Ganymede) or which planet had a sideways-rotation axis (Uranus), for example.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><blockquote>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin clearfix'></div>\n<div class='quote'>\n\"I spent almost all of my spare time poring over that book and memorizing the planet and moon facts on the back of each photo.\"\n</div>\n<footer>\n<cite>- Sarah \"Sally\" Dodson-Robinson</cite>\n</footer>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin'></div>\n</blockquote></span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>How did you end up working in the space program?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>By the time I went to college at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) I had decided that I would get a job in industry. I still liked astronomy, but I didn't know if it was a \"real\" career path. I also liked photography, so I decided to get a degree in imaging science. That way I could go and design printers for Kodak or chips for Intel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I didn't start thinking about graduate school until my junior year. There were a couple of astronomers on the imaging science faculty and I got a job with one of them reducing observations of binary stars. Once I started doing the research -- making it part of my day-to-day routine -- I hardly wanted to do anything else. My advisor told me I could be a \"real\" astronomer and make it my job by getting a Ph.D. in astronomy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I applied to graduate schools, I was not at all confident that I would be accepted anywhere: imaging science is an unconventional bachelor's degree for a graduate student in astronomy -- most students study physics or astrophysics. I was extremely surprised when I was accepted into all the schools I had applied to except one. I chose the University of California at Santa Cruz (UCSC) because it had an active research program on exoplanets and the solar system, and because Santa Cruz has good weather -- I was very tired of the cold, gray northeast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UCSC turned out to be a very good fit for me. I immediately started working with the N2K planet hunting consortium and I really enjoyed helping to discover new planets. However, planet hunting is an extremely competitive, fast-moving field and it is not particularly suitable for a graduate student who needs time to learn new research methods.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At this time, I became interested in the chemical aspects of planet formation. I had always been bothered that astronomers spent a lot of time and energy understanding Jupiter's formation, but not Saturn's. (Many of the known exoplanets are similar in mass to Jupiter, and so Jupiter had become the prototype planet.) However, I felt that the other planets in the solar system were being neglected as objects of study.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I decided to do my thesis on the chemistry of planet formation, with a focus on Saturn. (I later applied this research in a very fun way to the exoplanet astronomers call \"hot Saturn.\") My ability to choose my own thesis project was a direct result of receiving the National Science Foundation (NSF) fellowship. All of the chapters in my thesis were projects that I had designed, which made me very heavily invested in the outcome of the research.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In my final year of grad school I applied for 17 jobs, which is actually a modest number compared to some of my colleagues. Most of the applications I did were for postdocs, but a few were for faculty positions. My goal was just to get on a faculty shortlist and experience the interview process; I never thought that I would get an actual offer. The first postdoc offer I received was for the Spitzer Fellowship. I was at first relieved to have any job offer at all, and then excited because it was one of my top choices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After I had accepted the Spitzer Fellowship, and while still in my final year of grad school, I found out that I had made the shortlist at the University of Texas (UT). I was extremely surprised, but I knew I had a fantastic opportunity and so I accepted the position. While on leave from UT for one year I used my Spitzer Fellowship to work at the NASA Exoplanet Science Institute. There I was able to continue working with one of my Ph.D. committee members and the team at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, with whom I had collaborated for my thesis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having the one year as a postdoc really helped me get my research program going. I had time without teaching or committee responsibilities to publish my remaining thesis papers, complete several new projects and start a new collaboration. Now I use my postdoc work as a foundation for a lot of the new research I'm doing as a faculty member.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is an Assistant Professor of Astronomy?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I am an Assistant Professor in the astronomy program at the University of Texas (UT). I teach undergraduate and graduate astronomy classes, including a class on the solar system. This class is a lot of fun because I get to teach a lot of the things that first got me interested in astronomy. I show some of the same pictures I had in my childhood Voyager II poster book, plus the beautiful new images from Cassini.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes the students get really excited by the class material. For example, they like to know exactly how big an asteroid has to be in order to wipe out life on Earth, or how long you would free fall if you jumped off a cliff on Uranus' moon Miranda, for example. I also interpret the title \"solar system\" rather broadly and include material on the exoplanets too -- other nearby solar systems!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career.</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Defending my Ph.D. was definitely a favorite moment. I went out of the room while the committee deliberated, and they only talked for a few minutes before my advisor called my cell phone and asked, \"Can Doctor Robinson please return to the conference room?\"</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Early on, I was inspired by Stephen Hawking. Later, I was inspired by my undergraduate and graduate advisors, Elliott Horch and Greg Laughlin. Mostly though, I was inspired when I saw real people working in the field.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It really helps to have some research experience in college if you want to go to graduate school. Especially since it appears that graduate admissions are getting tougher (in my opinion). It is also common now for graduate school applicants to have publications. While I don't believe undergraduate students should be under pressure to publish, they generally need at least one letter of recommendation that focuses on research skills in order to be competitive for most astronomy graduate programs. Try the Research Experience for Undergraduates program (see below) if your school doesn't have research opportunities.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I have a young baby, so taking care of her fills most of my non-working hours. Lately, my main hobby is walking outdoors since the baby can come with me in the stroller. I do like hiking, and when I have time, I also enjoy cooking and reading.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A science or math degree can be useful for so many exciting careers. For me, if I weren't an astronomer I'd be a climate scientist or any kind of Earth scientist. In fact, one thing I love about my specialty (planetary astronomy) is that I get exposure to Earth science.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Plus, there are so many choices for math and science majors that are not only interesting, but good for society. For example: oceanographer, medical researcher or environmental toxicologist. Stick with it and you'll have a rewarding career!</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><b>Read More:</b><br />\r\n*<a href='http://womeninplanetaryscience.wordpress.com/2010/05/11/women-in-planetary-science-meet-sally-dodson-robinson/' target='_blank'>Women in Planetary Science Post on Sally</a><br />\r\n*<a href='http://www.as.utexas.edu/astronomy/people/dodson-robinson/' target='_blank'>Sally's University of Texas (UT) Page</a><br />\r\n*<a href='http://mcdonaldobservatory.org/research/astronomers/dodson-robinson' target='_blank'>McDonald Observatory Page on Sally</a><br />\r\n*<a href='http://www.utexas.edu/news/2011/11/09/astronomy_robinson_career/' target='_blank'>UT Article on Sally Dodson-Robinson</a><br />\r\n*<a href='http://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=5517&amp;from=fund' target='_blank'>Research Experience for Undergraduates Program</a></p>\r\n",

      "body": "<h3><b>Where are you from? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I grew up on the Island of Oahu, Hawaii. I started at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory as a postdoc (modeling lava flows) in fall 2010 and was hired as a Systems Engineer in Spring 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Describe the first time you made a personal connection with outer space.</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I was an undergraduate math major at the California Institute of Technology and searching for an application of mathematics that would help me make more sense of what I was learning. I&rsquo;d also been taking the undergraduate geology core classes as they sometimes involved going outdoors. During my junior year, I took Planetary Surfaces with Dr. Bruce Murray (whom I later found out had been JPL&rsquo;s fifth director) and did a presentation on Europa chaos terrains. I was fascinated to learn about the different models proposed for the formation of these enigmatic features and the way in which scientists tried to discriminate between the models while having very limited observational data. In this, I realized I&rsquo;d found my application: modeling the evolution of planetary landforms.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>How did you end up working on the Europa Clipper project?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I serve as the Investigation Scientist for the Mapping Imaging Spectrometer for Europa (MISE), a near-infrared spectrometer that will help us determine the compositional components of specific features on Europa. From that, we can investigate geologic and chemical processes, and composition and habitability of the ocean.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about your job. What is an Investigation Scientist?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As an Investigation Scientist, my job is to watch the &ldquo;interface&rdquo; between the instrument and the rest of the spacecraft and Project so as to identify when changes in design on one side or the other would ripple through the &ldquo;interface.&rdquo; I then ensure the relevant folks on both sides are aware and communicating. My focus is on the science of MISE&mdash;I have an engineering counterpart (MISE Instrument Engineer Bogdan Oaida) who watches the engineering-related changes and effects across the &ldquo;interface.&rdquo; This work involves technical knowledge and attention, but also a huge amount of human interaction and the ability to connect large-picture goals to detailed implementation in both technical and human behavior areas. It's a mix that I find most interesting, frustrating, and rewarding. I was invited to my position as Investigation Scientist in 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment in your career. </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A really fun career highlight was in 2013, when my paper on Martian linear gully formation made a big media splash after JPL media shared our <a href=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/video/details.php?id=1226\">CO<sub>2</sub>-blocks-on-dunes field videos</a>. In response to the physics and geology presented, laypeople asked intelligent questions and made thoughtful comments on media sites and YouTube, and some were inspired to write poetry and short stories. It was thrilling for me to see the general public so excited about something that I found exciting.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My main advice is to always be creating opportunities. I&rsquo;ve been extremely lucky in the opportunities I&rsquo;ve been invited into at JPL (such as Deputy Project Scientist on a Discovery mission proposal, Investigation Scientist on Europa Clipper, and Science Systems Engineer in the Mars Program Office). But while serendipity has a role in being in the right place at the right time (usually more like being on the right person&rsquo;s mind at the right time), a person can do a lot to maximize the chances of that happening. Networking in all directions (upwards, downwards, sideways), self-promotion with honest presentation of what you offer and what you want, saying &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to growth opportunities where you&rsquo;re less sure you have the time or capabilities needed, but also saying &ldquo;no&rdquo; sometimes to ensure you can focus and develop depth and a solid reputation in a few key areas. All of these are strategies help increase the chances that your name and abilities will be considered when a relevant opportunity comes up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My other main advice is to be open to opportunities that seem tangential to your overall goal. Sometimes those opportunities give you exposure or experience that will help you stand out from the crowd when you focus back in towards your main goal. Sometimes they help illuminate an alternative path that becomes your main goal. Sometimes they are fulfilling to your person in a completely different way from your main work. And sometimes they&rsquo;re just fun&mdash;everyone needs a bit of fun to keep motivated. I&rsquo;ve gotten into several &ldquo;side&rdquo; projects that end up being the work that other people care the most about (e.g., present-day Martian gully activity) or that just help me keep going (e.g., a trip to help build a school in Uganda, which included painting a solar system mural across the fourth-year classroom wall).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do outside of work?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I have tried to learn more about types of discrimination and their effects on people and productivity in this country, and how people have fought to improve systems and behaviors so that more people can be gainfully included in the grand adventures that can make up life and work. These lessons and historical stories inspire me as I work to improve my communities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I also enjoy trail running (I did a 50K in 2015), as that gets me outdoors and away from my computer, allowing me to think in a way that I don&rsquo;t often get to when in the office. I like to cook (and then feed people), and especially like experimenting with different oil and flour types when baking desserts, and providing options for those with eating restrictions. I relax by reading books. My favorite author is NK Jemisin&mdash;especially her \"Broken Earth\" series as it blends geological science with an alternate history/future and yet maintains such familiar human and cultural interactions and limitations. </p>\r\n",

When I was growing up she would talk about the amazing aircraft designed and built by Lockheed Martin and she would always bring home pictures, mugs and other things touting the amazing technology developed by Lockheed Martin. So given that exposure (or perhaps indoctrination) at home, coupled with tours of the <a href='http://www.jpl.nasa.gov' target='_blank'>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</a> (JPL), my fate was sealed early on. By the 5th grade my first long-term goal was set -- I was on a mission to become a mechanical engineer and work at JPL.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My mom greatly inspired me, as well as several JPL mentor/tutors I met while in high school. I am so grateful to all of them. Upon graduation, I asked one of the tutors what I could do to repay him and he said, \"Do the same thing for someone else.\" I really took it to heart and have been very involved in the community ever since.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is a Senior Thermal Systems Engineer? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My role as a senior thermal systems engineer is to ensure that the spacecraft and its payload remain within safe operating and survival temperature limits. I utilize a host of thermal analysis tools to determine the best approach for maintaining the temperature of the spacecraft and its payload. Thermal systems engineers use temperature sensors, thin film heaters, multi layer insulation (MLI) blankets, and other thermal control technologies like heat pipes to maintain safe operating and survival temperatures for spacecraft and payload components.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career. </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The launch of the Dawn spacecraft on September 27, 2007 was by far my favorite moment so far in my career. I had the honor of being the thermal mission operations team lead for the Dawn spacecraft. The mission operations role was new to me and the thermal complexity of the spacecraft made the job extremely challenging. The learning curve was steep and the pace of the project was very fast. The launch and check-out period presented some thermal challenges, however they were met and the spacecraft is performing well.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My advice is:<br />\r\n*Take heat transfer and thermodynamics classes as an undergraduate in college<br />\r\n*In graduate school pick a research project that allows you to exercise basic heat transfer principles<br />\r\n*Take all graduate courses in heat transfer, thermodynamics and fluid mechanics/dynamics that are offered<br />\r\n*Join student engineering organizations (Engineering Council, AIAA, ASME, NSBE, SHPE, AISES, SWE, etc.)</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I really enjoy hanging out with my daughter Lauren and my husband Mike. I also enjoy playing basketball, going to spinning class and watching football. Go Steelers!!!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Take as many math and science classes in high school as you can.</p>\r\n",

I'm the first generation that has left the area.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Describe the first time you made a personal connection with outer space.</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>When I was really little -- perhaps kindergarten -- I entered an essay contest called the \"My Space Trip Essay Contest.\" I wrote about my trip around the solar system to all the different planets with my aunt and my cousin. I think there were a couple of not-so-realistic elements of that story, but it started everything.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I also remember in first or second grade, when a friend's father who was an astronomer came to talk to our class for career day. He was asking everyone questions, and I didn't have a lot of answers at the time; I didn't know a ton about astronomy at that point. So instead I kept asking <i>him</i> questions in response to his questions because I wanted to know more. I think that said something about my interest and my passion for the subject. He gave me color printouts of Hubble images, and my mom was so happy that I was so happy that she framed them very nicely and hung them above my bed. They've been there ever since.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin clearfix'></div>\n<div class='quote'>\nI realized I could direct all of these energies and passions into hard problems that really matter and really excite me.\n</div>\n<footer>\n<cite>- Photo of Sophia Sanchez-Maes</cite>\n</footer>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin'></div>\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>How did you end up working in the space program?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I didn't always want to be a space scientist. I wanted to be a biochemist for a while, or a photographer or a ballet teacher. But finally, mathematics stuck. I wanted to be a theoretical mathematician for most of high school. That was my focus. I did math.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My senior year of high school, there was a university career fair. I typed up these resumes, and my family was stunned and a little shocked when they saw the output because my resumes had four different colors on them. They were purple, orange, blue and black. There were coding style comments in the margins, and instead of bullet points, I used little suns. They were convinced that no one in their right mind was ever going to hire me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But I went into the career fair and walked around and talked to the different employers, and I came away with quite a few interviews. When it came down to it, it was between JPL and a large tech company. It was very clear to me that JPL is where I need to be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was coming into this internship last summer that things shifted for me. JPL is such an incredible place with incredible people using these tools I was already in love with to make amazing, impossible, incredible things happen, and that energy is exciting because it's directed toward something, which isn't as tangible in theoretical mathematics. So when I realized I could direct all of these energies and passions into hard problems that really matter and really excite me, that was huge. So coming into college, I decided this is what I wanted to do, and I'm majoring in astrophysics.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I really look up to my grandparents. They both have done so much to keep our crazy family of so many people together, and they have an incredible love for people. That love is what I've tried to emulate in all aspects of my life.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='image_module left' style='width: Photo of Sophia Sanchez-Maes in front of a sign with the logos for JPL and NASA.px;'>\n<figure class='inline_figure'>\n<img src='/images/content/sophiaJPL_835.jpg'>\n<figcaption>\nSophia Sanchez-Maes at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career.</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It was July 4, 2016, coming to JPL for the Juno orbit insertion, seeing this incredible mission come to fruition. It will really propel me and drive me in my work and my passion for what goes on here.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What are you looking forward to in your career?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In my lifetime, we are definitely going to develop the ability to detect biosignatures on other planets. I would really love to be involved in the project that eventually does find life elsewhere in the universe. That would be incredible.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give someone who wants to take the same career path as you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Stay strong and go after things. I read about this yesterday: Paris had these \"innovation fellows.\" People were applying who are urban planners and technology developers, and they had one application from an 11-year-old girl who basically said, \"I'm trying to build a robot, and I don't know how to do it. It's not working, so I'd love to be one of your innovation fellows so that your mentors can help me get my robot to work because the streets of Paris are sad, and I think my robot will make them happier.\" It was such an amazing story. They selected her as one of their innovation fellows alongside all these people with Ph.D.s because that passion is so important. I feel like there are so many people who love to give these opportunities. I've certainly benefitted from opportunities that are equally unlikely.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I really love my work. It's so fun it barely feels like work, but outside of the lab, I really love running. It's a lot of fun for me, and it's a way for me to forget about all the little things that run around in my brain. I really enjoy playing music and listening to music, too; I play the violin. And I really enjoy talking to people, reading books and being with my family.</p>\r\n",

      "body": "<h3><b>Where are you from?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I was born in Karlskoga, Sweden and my family immigrated to Oakland, Calif. in 1955.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Describe the first time you made a personal connection with outer space.</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I was 10 years old and walking home from a Cub Scout meeting on a cold March evening. My papa pointed to the three stars in the belt of Orion and said to me in Swedish, \"Look how bright the Three Wise Men are tonight.\" As soon as we got home I moved my rock collection off the top of my desk and opened up some books on astronomy to learn more about stars.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=''>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin clearfix'></div>\n<div class='quote'>\n\"An astronomer is, above all else, an explorer and a dreamer.\"\n</div>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin'></div>\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Within a week I had read every astronomy book in my school's library, including my family's collection of Swedish encyclopedias at home! Within a few years the \"Outer Limits\" television series debuted, and I started building my first telescope. On Boy Scout camping trips I would bring a camera and tripod and photograph the night sky. As the NASA Gemini and Apollo programs unfolded, there was no stopping my interest in astronomy. By the time I was 14 years old, I had by then also discovered science fiction novels by Isaac Asimov, Robert A. Heinlein, Arthur C. Clarke and others that consumed much of what little free time I had as a teenager.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>How did you end up working in the space program?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It wasn't easy, even with a Ph.D. in Astronomy from Harvard! While other young astronomers entered the workforce as postdocs and then assistant professors, I turned down a prestigious postdoc on the west coast to stay on the east coast so that my wife could continue her education and establish herself as I had done. We wound up in Washington, D.C. and promised we would only stay here for two to five years. We are still here 20 years later! After leaving Harvard, my first postdoc was at the Space Sciences division of the Naval Research Laboratory, but that only lasted 7 years until the grant money ran out. Then I worked under a contract to NASA Headquarters as an astronomer doing education work for two years, after which I returned to full-time research working with the history-making COBE project at NASA's <a href='http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/home/index.html' target='_blank'>Goddard Space Flight Center</a> (GSFC). When that program ended, I was asked to be the director of the education and public outreach program, which eventually ended in 2005 when the satellite failed. By that time I had begun work on another program with the Hinode mission and had begun to bring in my own grant money for doing education work. My wife and I were able to raise two wonderful daughters from a geographically-stable home environment in Washington; something that would have been impossible as a wandering graduate student looking for an academic position in the 1980's. My wife also got hired into a permanent position at the Library of Congress in the late 1980s, so our gamble of just staying in one geographic place did pay off in the end. There are many different ways to be an astronomer working for NASA. You just have to be creative, flexible and not too stubborn!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If I had to pick one, my one true hero and source of inspiration would have to be my papa. He came to the United States with a big family when he was 44 years old, could not speak English very well, worked in the shipyards nearly all his life, yet his soul was that of an adventurer. He loved the opera and reading good books filled with exotic stories. He was good at geometry because at work he had to design things with sheet metal. He was athletic and biked to work every day until he retired. People thought he was a bit strange because he liked to wear shorts in the summer and bicycle -- not things adult men did in the 1950s and 1960s in Oakland -- but typical in Europe! He taught me everything I know about having a passion for adventure, not worrying about what other people think of you, keeping as physically fit as you can every day, and staying optimistic and in good humor. Shortly before he died at the age of 79 he told me, \"Today I feel like I am 40!\"</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is a Research Astronomer?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>An astronomer is, above all else, an explorer and a dreamer. Of course he studies the Universe and tries to answer many clever questions about it, but in the end he knows that it is only his imagination that will let him walk on a distant world, or see a black hole up close. The thrill of being able to apply basic mathematics and physics to understanding in a deep way how things <i>out there</i> work is a thrill that the non-scientist can not easily imagine, but can aspire to. Every research paper we write that uncovers a bit of the <i>great mystery of life</i> is like the rush an artist gets completing a canvas, a poem or an intricate musical score. This is why scientists and artists are kindred spirits in life's journey. No one really understands them very well, but without a little art and astronomy, society is much the poorer.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career.</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It would have to be the thrill of finding something obvious that so many had overlooked before. This happened to me when I was using infrared data from the COBE satellite to determine, just for fun, whether the satellite had seen anything beyond the Milky Way galaxy other than the famous cosmic background radiation. Lo and behold, when I cross-compared the data against catalogs of the known positions of nearby galaxies, I found over 200 position matches. This led to a very fun paper where I could measure how much cold dust these galaxies contained. Even though such a project had never been considered when the COBE science team put together the research goals for the satellite, I had found a very <i>cool</i> project that serendipitously led to a significant result. I had a smirk on my face for months!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Try not to measure your worth in terms of how successful others seem to be. There are people out there who are smarter than you, no matter what your GPA is. Your advantage is the same one that scientists have enjoyed for centuries. You are stubborn; you do not give up just because the question you are pursuing an answer to has become more difficult; and you partially live in a fantasy world where you put things together in unusual ways and sometimes these lead to a major discovery. It is absolutely true that scientists are adults who never stopped being <i>children at play.</i> Your playfulness with the world around you is the battery that will drive your scientific creativity. Creativity in science is the <i>wild card.</i> It is not something you can create by following a set of directions in life the way many people in the adult world want you to do. It is not correlated with GPA or raw intelligence. As for getting into astronomy, of course you have to be as good as you can be in science and mathematics, as well as in English and public speaking. You cannot hope to be an astronomer if you have not mastered the tools that astronomers use to carry out their investigations and detective work. But if you truly want to be an astronomer, because that is the direction your creativity is driving you, you will approach all these other issues and challenges with a sense of adventure, patience and humor. The really fun thing is that your interests may take you in directions that will surprise you and have nothing to do with a career in astronomy. Don't worry about the destination, just enjoy the journey as much as you can!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I used to be an amateur astronomer until I got my Ph.D. in astronomy. Since that time, I really enjoy biking, weight lifting and running. You can throw in writing for magazines, books and doing occasional radio and television programs too. I thoroughly enjoyed the visit of the film crew of Discovery Channel's \"Naked Science\" television program to my home a few years ago. They filmed me talking about magnetic fields convecting in the sun's surface plasma while I made a pot of spaghetti. I have also done several video programs for \"NASA CONNECT\" where I was the co-host. Too bad I didn't get into television when I was younger and actually looked good on camera!</p>\r\n",

If you want to inspire someone into the space program, land on the moon for the first time on their seventh birthday! It was the Space Age, and I got thoroughly caught up in the worldwide excitement about exploring space.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then, when I was nine years old, the Golden Valley library opened in my backyard. The books I discovered on their shelves opened my eyes to the wonder of airplanes, spacecraft, astronomy and science fiction. I vividly recall the mind-blowing experience of realizing how big the universe really is. Through science fiction, I really enjoyed exploring possible futures and where humanity&rsquo;s discoveries and inventions could lead. Each of the genres infused me with a sense of how logic and beauty could intersect to inspire wonder.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin clearfix'></div>\n<div class='quote'>\n\"Find out what you&rsquo;re passionate about and follow it.

Volunteer at a museum or recreational facility.\"\n</div>\n<footer>\n<cite>- Steven Lee</cite>\n</footer>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin'></div>\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>How did you end up working in the space program?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I was so enthusiastic about space, I naturally thought, &ldquo;How can I ever work in the space program when everyone will want to?!?!&rdquo; So I carefully laid out a plan in high school and college. Knowing that Minneapolis-based Honeywell designed the flight control system for every crewed spacecraft from Mercury through the Space Shuttle, I decided to focus my studies on control systems at the University of Minnesota. The plan was to get a summer job at Honeywell then transfer to the space division in Clearwater, FL, which is exactly how it worked out. Of course, I later learned that it&rsquo;s not nearly so competitive to work in the space program. There are many paths to a career in space exploration, most of which don&rsquo;t need to be nearly so carefully defined.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Naturally, one of my biggest inspirations was Neil Armstrong, not only for his accomplishments but his Midwestern modesty and easygoing manner. I eventually managed to fulfill a childhood dream when I met him at the 35th anniversary and he wished me a happy birthday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As I studied the space program in more detail, I was inspired by the brilliant and gutsy leadership of the early pioneers of the space program. For example, George Low was the low-key, unassuming Apollo spacecraft program manager. In April 1968, a Saturn V launched the unmanned Apollo 6 capsule. However, the rocket suffered excessive vibration so severe it would have injured any crew on board; two second stage engines shut down and the third stage engine failed to re-light in orbit. After careful evaluation and fixes, Low decided that the next Saturn V launch would not only carry humans, but take them all the way to the moon for the first time -- a gutsy but well-considered, rational decision. This mission, Apollo 8, sent the crew around the moon and back in a highly successful and inspiring feat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At JPL, an important mentor of mine was John Klein, a former Deputy Project Manager for the Mars Science Laboratory. John brought an amazingly optimistic, bright viewpoint to his work, mixed with tremendous intelligence and exellent judgment. He was also very focused on helping future generations fulfill their potential, which has inspired me to look for opportunities to help mentor whenever I can. Sadly, John passed away shortly before landing, but we commemorated him by naming the first-ever drill target on Mars after him.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='image_module right' style='width: Color image of man with rocket.px;'>\n<figure class='inline_figure'>\n<img alt='FILE:Steve_MSL.jpg' src='/images/content/Steve_MSL.jpg'>\n<figcaption>\nSteve at the Atlas V rollout for Mars Science Laboratory.\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What does your job entail?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As Curiosity&rsquo;s Deputy Project Manager, I have the privilege of exploring Mars every day. No two days are ever the same since we&rsquo;re constantly conducting different activities and facing new challenges. There might be a new technical issue to resolve, a staffing problem, or budget revision to develop. It&rsquo;s easy to let yourself get tied up in the intricate details of managing such a complex mission, but I make a point to take a few minutes each day to immerse myself in the latest images from Mars. When you study the contiguous sequence of terrain the rover traverses over days, weeks and months, Mars starts to feel like a real place in a way that&rsquo;s hard to get from a single out-of-context photo. My memories of Curiosity&rsquo;s Martian traverses seem like memories of some of my favorite hikes on Earth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am also involved in advanced concept studies for potential missions to Enceladus, a moon of Saturn. Enceladus is an astonishing world shrouded in ice. In 2006, the Cassini spacecraft took an image of this moon back-lit by the sun. To the scientist&rsquo;s amazement, they discovered plumes of water ice spewing from fissures in the south pole of Enceladus. Further observations confirmed the presence of a global ocean underneath an ice shell. Cassini flew through the plumes several times and sampled the material with on-board instruments. This analysis revealed the presence of salts, indicating the ocean is in contact with a rocky core, and organics, indicating the raw materials for life might be available. Could there be living organisms thriving through Enceladus&rsquo; ocean? Cassini isn&rsquo;t equipped to answer that question, but it begs for a future mission to answer the ultimate question: Are we alone?</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career.</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Successfully landing Curiosity on Mars after eight years of hard work with a brilliant team was an amazing experience. I had the privilege of serving the Control Systems Manager for the Mars Science Laboratory. That role required deep involvement in many aspects of the design, development and testing of the rover systems. Along the way we faced many significant technical and programmatic challenges but also enjoyed some very satisfying accomplishments. It culminated in the tremendously gratifying landing night success and celebration. Like nerds winning the Super Bowl.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What are you looking forward to in your career?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;m focused on astrobiology missions, the search for life elsewhere in the universe. The Curiosity Rover plays a key role by exploring the past astrobiology potential of Mars. While not equipped to detect signs of ancient life directly, the rover&rsquo;s instruments allow us to explore whether Mars was ever hospitable for life with water, organics and energy sources. Curiosity has confirmed that Gale crater was once not only habitable, but habitable for millions of years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Beyond Mars, several worlds in the solar system are compelling. I&rsquo;m particularly intrigued by Enceladus, a moon of Saturn. An ocean of liquid water exists under the ice crust of Enceladus. Tidal flexing of the moon as it orbits Saturn has opened up fissures in the south polar region. Amazingly, plumes of water ice jet from these fissures into space. Some of the ice is actually spewed so fast it achieves escape velocity from Enceladus and enters orbit around Saturn forming the E-ring; another example of the convergence of science and beauty. It&rsquo;s a phenomenal target for an astrobiology mission since the contents of the ocean are being served up for the taking by a spacecraft flying by.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give someone who wants to take the same career path as you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Find out what you&rsquo;re passionate about and follow it. If you&rsquo;re not sure, explore as many experiences as you can to find what inspires your passion and sense of wonder. Go to an aquarium. Spend an hour watching how ants actually go about their business. Visit some national parks. Volunteer at a museum or recreational facility.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then try to get in touch with someone who already works in your career field of interest for advice. Find out what kinds of specialization and specific jobs are typically pursued, along with what type of education and experience is required so you can plan out your future.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I enjoy reading books about palaentology and early life on Earth. I figure that if I&rsquo;m interested in astrobiology, I should know a little about how life started and evolved on Earth. I also like snorkeling and diving, especially in search of exotic-looking creatures in coral reef ecosystems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My wife and I also have a life goal of visiting every unit in the National Park system. We&rsquo;ve already visited 332 but still have almost 100 to go, including some very remote ones in Alaska and the Pacific islands. Oh, and having grown up in Minnesota, I enjoy attending NHL hockey games and watching my son play high school hockey. (Yes, there are great ice hockey programs in Southern California!).</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><b>Read More</b>:<br />\r\n*<a href='http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/mission/overview/' target='_blank'>Mars Science Laboratory Homepage</a><br />\r\n*<a href='http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/mars-science-laboratory-curiosity-rover-msl/' target='_blank'>Curiosity Rover</a><br />\r\n*<a href='https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/enceladus' target='_blank'>More on Enceladus </a></p>\r\n",

      "body": "<h3><b>Where are you from?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I was born in Houston, Texas. But I lived outside Paso Robles, Calif. from age three to eight, and I spent my formative years in Bakersfield, Calif., graduating from Bakersfield High School. I now live in Los Angeles, Calif.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Describe the first time you made a personal connection with outer space.</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As a youngster I would watch the television show \"Muppet Babies.\" I remember watching a scene in one episode; it was a \"Star Wars\" episode. (\"Star Wars\" was another big influence for me.) Kermit had a miniature spaceship made out of cardboard, and he also used a black piece of cardboard with holes poked through it to simulate the stars. (When this cardboard was put to the light, \"stars\" shone through.) I was influenced by this episode to make a solar system viewer out of a shoe box as part of my project on Neptunefor my third grade class.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin clearfix'></div>\n<div class='quote'>\n\"Don't be afraid to ask questions, especially when you find yourself in a one-on-one conversation with an expert.\"\n</div>\n<footer>\n<cite>- Steven Vance</cite>\n</footer>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin'></div>\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>How did you end up working in the space program?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As an undergraduate at the University of California at Santa Cruz (UCSC), I was studying physics and German, as well as fixing audio-visual (A/V) equipment. I had multiple interests, but I eventually fell into a project involving the role of methanol in the formation of small particles in the dust cloud that became the solar system. At this point I hadn't yet decided to pursue a career with the space program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then, during a summer internship with a company that makes X-ray tubes, I befriended a brilliant young engineer who had recently dropped out of a graduate program in astronomy. During our lunches together we talked about humanity's trajectory in time and space, societal changes that needed to occur for us to become a truly space-faring global civilization and the significance of the discovery of alien life. These inspiring interactions came at a time when I was beginning to think about graduate school, and so I paid attention when I saw an advertisement for a National Science Foundation (NSF) funded interdisciplinary graduate program in astrobiology at the University of Washington.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I have been inspired by my father's technical prowess and zest for life, my mother's heart and creativity, my friends in high school, who taught me important lessons about life, and by <a href='Person:SaganC' target='_blank'>Carl Sagan</a>, who revealed the poetry of the cosmos.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is a Planetary Scientist/Astrobiologist?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Planetary scientists try to understand the planets, their formation, their place in the solar system and their similarity to planets around other stars. In our line of work, Earth is another planet, the one we know best. Astrobiologists apply the same approach to understand life, its origin and its prevalence in the rest of the Universe.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career.</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>One memorable moment is when I was working on the tunable laser spectrometer to test gases that might come up from the surface of Mars. It was wonderful to have been a part of the hypothesizing for this instrument and then to be able to see those hypotheses verified through experiments.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Take lots of math classes. Don't be afraid to ask questions, especially when you find yourself in a one-on-one conversation with an expert.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I like to play guitar and drums, sing, skydive, and read.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Follow your interests. Don't give up.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><b>Read More</b><br />\r\n*<a href='http://opfm.jpl.nasa.gov/' target='_blank'>Outer Planet Flagship Missions</a><br />\r\n*<a href='http://outerplanets.jpl.nasa.gov/' target='_blank'>Outer Planets Colloquium Series</a><br />\r\n*<a href='http://science.jpl.nasa.gov/people/Vance/' target='_blank'>Steven's JPL Science Division Profile</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n",

My dad took me to JPL's annual open house. It was like going to Disneyland for me. I still have the pins and handouts that were given out that particular day.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>How did you end up working in the space program? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I applied to JPL's summer internship program while in college. As a computer science major, JPL was my top choice for where I wanted to spend my summer. I was accepted into the student internship program and worked in JPL's IT department. I enjoyed the experience so much that I decided to re-apply for an internship the following summer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next summer, I was selected for Caltech's Student Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF) program. While interning with SURF, I developed software to support the mars Science Laboratory mission. (I worked in the same JPL group where I am today.) I was offered a job after the internship ended and quickly accepted it. As soon as I graduated college I started work at JPL. This was three months before MSL's historic landing on Mars -- I had to scramble to train for the MSL surface operations role.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Many different people have inspired me along the way. When I was in 8th grade, my parents helped me find a tutor at Caltech so I could explore my interest in computer science. I was tutored by former Caltech professor Ben Brantley for years. He was the one who inspired me to study computer science in college at Boston University. My professors there were also great role models.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is a Software Engineer? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I design software to solve problems. I spend most of my time working on MSL where I develop new software and maintain existing software. I also work on MSL operations so I often use the software I write to support MSL's day to day activities. This combination of software development and operations gives me a unique perspective that allows me to see where there are shortfalls or areas for improvement in mission software and be able to solve them. Besides MSL, I work for Advanced Multi-Mission Operations System (AMMOS) and Planetary Data System (PDS) where I design software that is shared across several missions.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career. </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I'll never forget the night when the Curiosity rover landed on Mars. I had trained for months for my surface operations role and had practiced extensively for the landing. To say it was tense would be an understatement -- there was so much uncertainty, and landing the rover with the sky crane seemed risky.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I remember when the first front hazard avoidance camera image arrived from the rover. It was just a thumbnail, but it was incredible. The feeling of camaraderie and success was unlike anything I had experienced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After landing, \"Mars Time\" started: Work schedules were based on what time it was on Mars instead of Earth. I had many shifts where I worked all night and slept all day. It was like having perpetual jet lag, but I loved it.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Working on a NASA mission requires many people with many different backgrounds. Specialize in something that you enjoy and that a mission would need and work hard at it. Apply to NASA internships whenever possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Spending time with friends and family. Film, live music and video games. I enjoy hiking and camping throughout California. I also play on the JPL softball league.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Study hard. You will get frustrated, even if you're studying something you enjoy. Don't let that discourage you.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><b>Read More: </b><br />\r\n*<a href='http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/' target='_blank'>Mars Science Laboratory Website</a><br />\r\n*<a href='http://msl-scicorner.jpl.nasa.gov/' target='_blank'>MSL Science Corner Website</a></p>\r\n",

I came to NASA's <a href='http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/' target='_blank'>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</a> (JPL) by way of the Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC), which is a department within the California Environmental Protection Agency (EPA.) My role at DTSC was to communicate the scientific information to the public related with the cleanup of toxic sites. With so many changes happening in the California budget, I was looking to find a similar position and found the perfect fit at JPL. The position was perfect because of JPL's diversity: I can work in the field of Earth science and enjoy and learn about space science at the same time.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is a Manager of Earth Science Public Engagement?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My goal is to make complex science understandable to the public. I manage a team of communications professionals who work as outreach and public engagement leads for JPL's Earth science missions. I also lead collaborative efforts, which include creatively and effectively incorporating education, outreach and media activities, in consultation with project managers, program scientists and key staff in order to develop and implement an integrated communications plan for the Earth theme.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career.</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I already have so many! I loved working at the Science Bowl, the Ocean Science Bowl, and at the FIRST Robotics competition. It was very inspiring to see so many young people who are interested in and excited about science. I also loved the JPL Open House, which brings together all of JPL's Earth science to show the public how we take the vital signs of our planet from space.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My mother was my greatest inspiration.

I hope she would be proud of me today.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Start much earlier than I did! It took me many years to find my passion. I started in scientific research, went into interior design, went into politics, became a paralegal (which I was terrible at), and then went into environmental science communication and public outreach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I also went back to school to get a master's degree in environmental policy at the age of 54. This came about from taking a trip to the jungles of Borneo. There I saw the rainforests being destroyed for palm oil plantations. Every day, mother and father orangutans are killed and babies are chained up or sold into the illegal pet trade in the name of palm oil. I returned home to Los Angeles and enrolled in graduate school.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I travel to faraway places, like Borneo, Sumatra, the Amazon, Bali, and Antarctica. I also took up scuba diving in 2009 and I have been diving in Belize and Indonesia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am active in various environmental and political causes, such as rescuing shelter dogs. I also work very hard to raise money for the Orang Utan Republik Foundation, a foundation which strives to help orangutans and the public's awareness of them and their habitat.

I am responsible for managing these two projects, making sure that each meets its schedule, that we follow the processes we have established and that we take as much science data as we can without adding risk to the mission. I am also responsible for making sure the activities happen within the budget. I travel to Washington D.C. two to three times each year to do the budget negotiations with NASA headquarters. When I go, I can cover both of my projects with one trip. I typically also take one science trip for each project. For example, I just got back from the American Geophysical Union (AGU) meeting -- that is where Voyager announces its science results. The American Astronomical Society meeting is where Spitzer announces its science results.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career. </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Voyager Uranus and Neptune encounters each hold favorite moments for me, especially the Neptune flyby. For this flyby I was responsible for commanding the closest approach sequence. That was a special moment for me in my career because I can look back at it and say I did it and it worked and look at all of this great data we got back. Before Voyager 2 we didn't have very good quality images of Uranus or Neptune, but every time we got closer and closer to those planets we always saw something new. And that is always exciting. That is why you get into this business -- to be able to do something new and exciting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Launches are always fun. I worked on Cassini and Spitzer during their launches. Seeing all that hard work pay off and get off the ground is always exciting, too.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the things that I always tell, particularly high school students, is that you need to have a good background in math and science, but you will not be able to get very far in your career if you cannot communicate your ideas. So, you need to pay attention to your English classes and to your history classes. You may be a super smart mathematician or computer programmer, but if you cannot sell your ideas to the person who is going to fund them or convince them that what it is you propose is the way to go then you are not going to get very far. You need to have communication skills, and I think some of that can be learned through English writing and speaking classes. An appreciation for history is important so that you can gain perspective on how the past effects the present and the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I am an avid Masters swimmer. I swim 4 times a week in the evenings for a couple miles at a time. I do an occasional swim meet or an ocean swim, but not as much as I used to do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I like to go on trips with my family. We've done a lot of interesting traveling. We have been to Iceland and Panama, as well as many car camping trips to places in such states as Utah and Arizona. I like being outdoors.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>You can never have too much math. Math is going to be the basis for all the science and engineering that you will have to do in the future. I also would suggest taking a programming class in a modern programming language. You almost cannot get away without doing some amount of programming.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><b>Read More</b><br />\r\n*<a href='http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/' target='_blank'>Voyager: The Interstellar Mission</a><br />\r\n*<a href='http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/' target='_blank'>Spitzer Space Telescope</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Articles</b><br />\r\n*<a href='http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2010-360' target='_blank'>New Project Manager as Voyager Explores New Territory</a><br />\r\n*<a href='http://www.whitman.edu/content/news/SuzanneDoddNASA' target='_blank'>Alumna Named Project Manager for NASA's Voyager Program</a></p>\r\n",

I grew up watching the various \"Star Trek\" series (\"Next Gen\" started when I was two-years old), and the idea of studying stars and planets grew from there. Every clear night I would be outside staring at the sky -- often without a jacket, much to the annoyance of my parents. As I got older though, I can remember two specific things that bolstered that interest even more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first was the Mars Pathfinder mission. Seeing photos of the Sojourner rover on the surface of Mars was just so fascinating to me. The second was NASA's \"Mars Millennium Project.\" (I saw a commercial for this project while watching \"Star Trek: Voyager\" on TV.) For this project, kids were asked to design a colony on Mars in the year 2030. I completely immersed myself in that project, learning everything I could about Mars, and I knew for certain at that point that I wanted a career in planetary science.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>How did you end up working in the space program? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I've always known that the professor path was not for me, since I love the hands-on technical side of things. When I finished my master's degree I had an internal struggle of whether continuing on as a Ph.D. or going into the working world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Malin Space Science System (MSSS), who has built cameras for a number of NASA missions, just so happened to be hiring right at the time I was graduating from Wesleyan University. This seemed to be a good fit since MSSS is unique, in that they both build and operate cameras for NASA missions and also do science.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, after a few years there I realized that in order to best pursue my career goals I should indeed get a Ph.D. (I would like to be the principal investigator of an instrument or mission.) I made the difficult decision to leave MSSS in order to go back to school. I am now a Ph.D. student in geology and planetary science at the University of Western Ontario in Canada.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is an Assistant Staff Scientist at MSSS? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>At MSSS, my primary duty was to target the Context Camera (CTX) aboard NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO). This meant that I got to pick what the camera took pictures of in a given week, and then analyze those pictures from the standpoint of a geologist. It was a fantastic opportunity: There aren't many people in the world who get paid to take pictures of Mars every day! I was also involved in operations for the Mastcam, Mars Descent Imager (MARDI) and Mars Hand Lens Imager (MAHLI) aboard Curiosity, the Mars Science Laboratory rover.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career. </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Seeing the first images I targeted for CTX. It was almost surreal -- not only are you picking what to take pictures of on Mars, you're also typically the first person on Earth to see those pictures when they come back from Mars.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Stephen Hawking has always been an inspiration to me as I also suffer from a physical disability. As a child interested in science, I always thought of how much he has been able to do and accomplish despite his ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). His accomplishments motivate me to keep trying.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If you're interested in getting involved in the space program, there are a wide variety of options available to you. I've heard some students tell me they love space, but aren't very good at math and/or science and so they've written off any dreams of working with NASA. To these kids I like to point out space-related career options that would not normally come to mind (i.e., computer science/programming, medical science, food science) and some that are not science-based at all (i.e., artists, pilots, technical writers, administrative positions, educational and public outreach jobs, etc.).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I love photography (which I also do as a business outside of my planetary science work) and traveling, the two of which go hand in hand. I guess being a scientist interested in space it's in my nature to explore.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Don't be afraid to get in contact with professors, students or even working professionals in the field that you're interested in. It's never too early to make those connections that might come in handy later on as far as applying to graduate school, applying for jobs or looking for people to collaborate with on research projects. Being proactive also shows initiative and helps you to stand out from the crowd.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you're an undergrad, don't just select the places you apply to graduate school based on their name or prestige. Think about what specific area of planetary science interests you, and then look for papers on that topic to see who's working on it. Check the websites of those people and get in touch with them ahead of time if you think you'd be interested in working with them. Since you're going to dedicate a few years to working with that person, it's good to get a feel for them ahead of time to see if they are indeed someone you'd want to work with. Plus, it's helpful if they already know who you are when your application comes across their desk. Every master's and Ph.D. program I was accepted into were at universities where I had been in touch with the professors I wanted to work with for quite some time before actually applying.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><b>Read More: </b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>*<a href='http://www.tanyaharrisonofmars.com' target='_blank'>Tanya's Personal Website</a><br />\r\n*<a href='https://twitter.com/tanyaofmars' target='_blank'>Tanya's Twitter Handle: @tanyaofmars</a><br />\r\n*<a href='http://womeninplanetaryscience.wordpress.com/2010/10/07/tanya-harrison-being-proactive-helps-you-stand-out-from-the-crowd/' target='_blank'>Post on the Women in Planetary Science Blog</a><br />\r\n*<a href='http://marsprogram.jpl.nasa.gov/mro/' target='_blank'>Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter Website</a><br />\r\n*<a href='http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/' target='_blank'>Mars Science Laboratory Website</a><br />\r\n*<a href='http://www.marspapers.org/abstr/Harrison_2000abstr.htm' target='_blank'>Tanya's Mars Millennium Project Abstract</a><br />\r\n*<a href='http://www.marspapers.org/papers/Harrison_2000.pdf' target='_blank'>Tanya's Mars Millennium Project Full Proposal</a></p>\r\n",

I now reside in Covina, Calif.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Describe the first time you made a personal connection with outer space.</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The first time I made a connection with outer space was when I was in elementary school. We were learning about the Space Shuttle during its maiden voyage. And after teaching us about the Space Shuttle and space travel, my teacher asked us to draw a picture about what we had learned and how we felt about outer space. I still have the picture I drew to this day.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin clearfix'></div>\n<div class='quote'>\n\"<span>Enjoy every opportunity you have to learn and make it a point to be involved in the most challenging projects</span>.\"\n</div>\n<footer>\n<cite>- Thomas Valdez</cite>\n</footer>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin'></div>\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>How did you end up working in the space program?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I was very lucky to have been selected to work in the space program right out of high school. This is how it happened -- two incredible recruiters from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory came to my high school to interview students, and I was selected. I have worked at JPL ever since.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is a Senior Member Engineering Staff, Fuel Cell Group Lead?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My research focus is in catalyst development for fuel cells and electrolyzers. I also design fuel cell systems for robotic and terrestrial applications. The importance of developing a fuel cell power source for robotic applications is that a fuel cell can increase the energy a robot can carry during a mission. The advantage of a fuel cell power source for terrestrial applications is that the power source can be designed to have energy densities many times greater than batteries.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career.</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It seems that every year I have another favorite moment at work. One of my most memorable moments was the first time I presented my research at a technical conference as a professional.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One recent memorable moment has been working on a fuel cell system for the JPL <a href='http://www-robotics.jpl.nasa.gov/systems/system.cfm?System=11' target='_blank'>ATHLETE</a> robot. The ATHLETE robot traveled 1 km on fuel cell power. It was incredible to see the successful completion of this milestone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another recent memorable moment was the building and launch of a power source for an ocean profiler named <a href='http://solo-trec.jpl.nasa.gov/SOLO-TREC/' target='_blank'>Solo-TREC</a>. (Solo-TREC is a sea probe that measures water salinity and temperature in the ocean and profiles these parameters from the surface of the ocean to about 500 m in depth.) What makes the Solo-TREC special, besides being the first probe of its kind, is that it harvests energy from temperature differences in the ocean.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I have been inspired in different ways by my teachers and mentors. Mr. Art Callahan, my junior high school science teacher, inspired me to fall in love with science and scientific investigations. Mr. Jaime Escalante, my high school math teacher, taught me how to work hard and never give up. (I owe my career to Mr. Escalante; he gave me the tools I needed to be successful in science.) And my mentor Dr. S. R. Narayan, who is my inspiration in science, helped develop my love for electrochemistry.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Enjoy every opportunity you have to learn and make it a point to be involved in the most challenging projects. Approach every problem with a smile and a positive attitude.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I head to the beach during the summer and I like to ski in the local mountains during the winter. I also enjoy hiking, running and mountain bike riding all year round.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The advice I give students is to form a good understanding of the problems they are working on. In order to develop a fun career in science, math or engineering it takes a little discipline when you are young. Establishing good fundamentals is crucial to developing a fun career in any discipline.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><b>Read More</b><br />\r\n*<a href='http://www-robotics.jpl.nasa.gov/systems/system.cfm?System=11' target='_blank'>ATHLETE Robot</a><br />\r\n*<a href='http://solo-trec.jpl.nasa.gov/SOLO-TREC/' target='_blank'>Solo-TREC</a><br />\r\n*<a href='multimedia/video-view.cfm?Vid_ID=1049' target='_blank'>Watch Video: Our Solar System Through the Eyes of Scientists -- Meet Thomas Valdez</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Links to Videos, stories, etc.</b><br />\r\n*<a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDvoe091tk4' target='_blank'>YouTube: NASA ATHLETE</a></p>\r\n",

I ended up doing lightning protection of aircraft. This was quite thrilling, especially when we flew into thunderstorms for lightning-strike tests. Later, I transferred to FAA Headquarters in Washington, D.C. as a science advisor. From there, I only needed to cross the street to reach NASA headquarters.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>All the great scientists were an inspiration to me from an early age. I would enjoy reading about their lives and discoveries. The challenges of space flight (manned and unmanned) continue to be an inspiration to me, as well as the dedication and hard work of all my colleagues at NASA.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is a Program Executive/Scientist? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I work as a program executive for MESSENGER and Dawn and scientist for several planetary missions, including a number of international collaborations (Rosetta, BepiColombo, Akatsuki, and Hayabusa, for example).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The PE has several complex roles, but perhaps a short description would be that she/he is mainly an interface between Headquarters and the centers. She/he makes sure that the projects are executed according to the appropriate NASA guidelines.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career. </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Critical mission events are particularly exciting. These are the moments that take place during a mission which could make a difference between success and failure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, there are many of these moments in every mission, and so I hesitate in naming just one, but the landing of the NEAR spacecraft on asteroid Eros was one of those moments.

I read mainly science and ancient history articles and books -- Celtic history and mythology are my particular favorites. I also enjoy music -- mainly bagpipe music ... I have my own bagpipe, but I do not think you would want to hear me play.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Try to pick an area of interest to concentrate on.

The fact that it was formed from a giant cloud of gas and dust spewed out by supernovas and it all came together under gravity and made the sun and all the planets -- I thought it was bananas that scientists could figure all that out based on what they can see today. I remember thinking, \"That's really cool that we can know that about space.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin clearfix'></div>\n<div class='quote'>\nThe important thing about being a scientist or an engineer is learning how to think critically, learning how to be creative, learning problem solving and learning how to learn.\n</div>\n<footer>\n<cite>- photo of Tracy Drain</cite>\n</footer>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin'></div>\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>How did you end up working in the space program?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>When I started thinking in high school about what I wanted to do for my career, math, science and space seemed like things that could keep me interested for an entire career.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was a Jet Propulsion Laboratory booth at a career fair that I went to in my second and final year in grad school at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Embarrassingly, I'd never heard of JPL, but once I realized that JPL was the center that did Voyager, Pathfinder and so many other amazing missions, I practically pounced on the poor recruiters. I got a call sometime later to come interview and practically drooled all over everyone they would let me talk to. I was offered a job by Steve Matousek in the systems engineering division (though I'd never heard the phrase \"systems engineering\" until I'd talked to him!).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My mom was always very excited about airplanes and spacecraft and anything to do with space, whether it was real or fiction. She was always pointing out airplanes overhead and having us watch space shuttle launches on TV. She was very big into Star Trek, Star Wars, Battlestar Galactica and all of that stuff. So I soaked that all in from her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She was always very supportive of anything I wanted to do or try. She was never a person to say, \"You can't do that\" or, \"You shouldn't do that.\" It was always, \"OK! What are we going to do to make that happen?\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I also had some really cool teachers through middle school and high school. I was in math competitions in high school, and I remember one day we were all in a minivan driving down the freeway to a competition with my ninth grade math teacher, Mrs. Brown. In Kentucky freeways run through big chops in hills, and in the winter, water will flow down the vertical face and freeze into these giant icicles. As we drove by, I said, \"I've always wanted to break off one of those.\" She said, \"OK!\" and pulled over, instilling in me this idea that you should go explore things that you want to do. That was something that reminded me to take those opportunities and be an exploring person, because why not?</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='image_module left' style='width: photo of Tracy Drain with Star Wars droid BB-8px;'>\n<figure class='inline_figure'>\n<img src='/images/content/tracybb8_350.jpg'>\n<figcaption>\nTracy Drain enjoying a visit from Star Wars droid BB-8 in the Spacecraft Assembly Facility at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What does your job entail?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>When you think about a spacecraft and all the different parts that are necessary to make a spacecraft work, there are engineers who focus on making each of those specific systems. But a flight systems engineer is responsible for knowing enough about all those things that we can make sure they come together in a design that will accomplish the overall goals of the mission.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The things I do on a day to day basis change over the course of the life cycle of a mission. Early on, you're involved in the requirements and rules the design has to follow so you can meet your mission goals. So you work with people at all the different levels to develop the requirements and make sure all those rules are written properly. Then systems engineers are involved with verifying those requirements and developing tests and sitting in on the tests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then after launch and during operations, you're flying the spacecraft. I would help develop command products that would be sent to the spacecraft to make it do activities. It's all about monitoring the information that's coming down from the spacecraft, making sure it's responding the way it's suppose to, and if things go wrong, understanding what went wrong and helping the team get back on track.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It makes for a very exciting, never dull, kind of job.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career.</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter launch will be my favorite for a long time. It was my first launch, and I was doing a lot of things for someone who'd only been at the Lab for five years. I was involved in the systems team, helping to develop some of the command products. I was trained as an ACE, someone who communicates with the Deep Space Network when we're sending commands and monitoring the connection to the spacecraft.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the day of launch, we are there listening to the count down, and you're a little horrified because your vehicle is strapped to a giant rocket and you have no control over that part. But it was so exciting! You could see in the telemetry you got coming down through the launch vehicle that everything was clocking out. It was a picture perfect launch.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What are you looking forward to in your career?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I'm looking forward to all the awesome science that's going to come out of the Juno mission.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the next missions I'm interested in would be Europa. That mission is near and dear to my heart because of all the possibilities that exist there on that moon that has a thick shell of ice and maybe water underneath.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give someone who wants to take the same career path as you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I really wish someone had told me that the important thing about being a scientist or an engineer is learning how to think critically, learning how to be creative, learning problem solving and learning how to learn so that you get a fundamental understanding of things so you can attack new problems you've never seen before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I was in middle school and high school, the way the school system seemed to work was to make you focus on getting a grade -- \"How do I get my <i>A</i>?\" You're drowning in so much homework that you're looking for the shortcuts to get an <i>A</i>, and that is not the best way to really learn the material deeply and foster that high level of critical thinking. I think I would have had a different educational experience if I was able to shift my focus to that.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I read a lot, and it used to be 100 percent science fiction and fantasy, but a few years ago I discovered the world of nonfiction. I just wander through the stacks of the library and pick up whatever catches my attention. I feel like I've learned so much! I also watch documentaries on Netflix. There is so much great stuff to learn out there.</p>\r\n",

My fascination with rocks and geology also emerged around this time, though it was a bit starved for stimulation in the flatlands of east Texas.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin clearfix'></div>\n<div class='quote'>\n\"While being gay has never impacted my opportunities for employment, my ability to do my job, or my relationship with my colleagues, it is an important part of who I am.

My interest, however, shifted following the Challenger Disaster (I was in second grade at the time, and watched it live on TV). I continued to indulge scientific curiosity, but branched out into various different fields (oceanography and botany among the most prominent). That was until high school, when I attended the US Space Academy (i.e., Space Camp for high schoolers) and rediscovered that space was my true passion (I ended up going back to the Academy twice more before graduating high school!). I pursued my interest in earth and planetary sciences while an undergrad at MIT, alongside what at the time seemed a more \"practical\" career supporting study of materials science and engineering. But by the time I graduated in 2000, I had discovered that I *could* have a career that combined my loves of space, rocks, and engineering into one. Following an internship at NASA Ames, I spent 7 years at CalTech earning my Ph.D. in Geology and Planetary Science, with a great deal of my thesis research spent in experimental projects (I loved being in the lab and getting my hands dirty). A colleague working at JPL on the Phoenix mission asked me to come and work as an instrument engineer on a piece of Phoenix hardware (the TECP) when my Ph.D. was complete. I had chosen CalTech for grad school precisely for its affiliation with JPL and was thrilled to land a true 'dream job' from my childhood: Designing, building, testing, and flying hardware into space to do geology on other planets, and then doing science with the results! Perfect!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My mother was an excellent teacher and her most important lesson to me was learning how to learn. She gave me the tools to ask my own questions and find my own answers. Carl Sagan was a big influence, first through his COSMOS series, and then through his writings. He and my favorite science fiction author, Arthur C. Clarke, are able to take complex and subtle ideas and make them accessible to anyone without robbing them of their beauty and elegance. Like them, I strive to convey both the information and the excitement of my work, regardless of my audience. And my best friend in high school, Meredith Patterson, showed me (by her example) that even though I was passionate about science, math, and engineering, I didn't have to fit into the standard mold for the 'nerd' or 'bookworm.' Though it pre-dated the show by decades, I learned from her that my personality needn't be limited to the character types in the cast of \"The Big Bang Theory\" (Nonetheless, I'm a fan!).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is an Instrument System Engineer?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Systems Engineering is what I call a 'big picture' discipline. Spacecraft and their subsystems are very complicated and are subject to large variety of constraints, environments, and interfaces. It's the job of a systems engineer to be concerned with how their piece (instrument or other subsystem) interacts with itself and all the external influences it is subjected to. We're responsible for ensuring that our piece plays nice with the spacecraft and the project: all the parts fit together, all the requirements have been met, all the capabilities have been demonstrated, and all of the documentation proving those things is in place. In one sense it's about making sure nothing falls through the cracks. But a better description would be that we're the engineers that make sure there are no cracks to fall through!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career.</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Prior to working on the InSight mission, I was the principal investigator for a high-altitude balloon project called ASTRA. ASTRA's aim was to demonstrate the function of some prototype Mars surface instruments in an environment (Earth's stratosphere) that's quite similar to Mars in several ways. ASTRA was part of a program at JPL designed to give early-career employees a chance to work in the style of a space-flight project. We learned the way JPL does business: all the reviews, all the mission assurance checks, and all the processes and practices that make JPL so successful. It was a VERY steep learning curve, and we spent over two years preparing for a 4 hour flight. There was a moment at the launch site when the gondola slipped off the end of the crane and began to lift silently into the clear morning sky over New Mexico - I was filled with a great sense of peace and satisfaction of a job well done. (Quite a different moment from the drama of a rocket launch or descent through the martian atmosphere!)</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give someone who wants to take the some career path as you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A background in both science and engineering is invaluable as a systems engineer: you need to be able to speak the language of both camps. Training as both, and doing whatever you can to 'straddle the fence'. Learn to understand the desires of science (and how it can sometimes be fuzzy) and the limitations of engineering (and how it doesn't permit any fuzziness) and how to find a harmony between the two.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In recent years, great strides have been made in gay rights and in the visibility of LGBT people. From Barney Frank to Michael Sam to Ellen DeGeneres to Caitlyn Jenner - there are numerous examples for LGBT people to look up to. But I think most people outside the field would be hard pressed to name a living scientist or engineer... much less one who identifies as gay. While being gay has never impacted my opportunities for employment, my ability to do my job, or my relationship with my colleagues, it is an important part of who I am. I have to actively work against its invisibility. I want my colleagues to know - perhaps one of them has a family member who is struggling to come to terms with their sexuality. I want to be available as a resource and as a friend. I also want the public to know - perhaps an LGBT youth aspiring to a career in science or engineering might have me to hold up as an example.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Body-building is a favorite past-time: it's a great stress reliever and a hobby that I can take with me when I travel for work or for pleasure. It's also a great expression of responsibility and ownership: What I've accomplished is due entirely to my dedication and choices, and it belongs to no one but me. When time permits, I love taking my motorcycle up into the canyons, or taking my lifted Jeep out into the wilderness for some good camping time in the mountains (making up for my upbringing in the flatlands!) My boyfriend and I enjoy travelling... and dancing!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There are so many great resources available today: you can read books, watch you-tube videos, follow science new stories and forums. But don't forget to try out experiments for yourself, take things apart and see how they work, and ask critical questions. There's a good deal of mis-information floating around the world, some of it packaged very enticingly. Don't be afraid to say, \"I don't think that's right,\" out loud&mdash;you might start a lively discussion! Oh, and familiarize yourself with the idea of Cognitive Biases. Remind yourself occasionally that for all its powers of reason, the human mind has some odd quirks that can skew your perceptions.</p>\r\n",

My father was the chief of police and, as a rule in Turkey, a policeman can&rsquo;t stay in one city for more than five years. We moved to a few other cities like Karabuk, Zonguldak, and Canakkale until I finish my high school. Since then, I&rsquo;ve moved a lot internationally, from London to Groningen, and from the Canary Islands to Leiden.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Describe the first moment you made a connection with outer space.</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I feel like the passion was always there from a very early age. At primary school, I remember we had a thick science encyclopedia that I read cover to cover a few times. And growing up, we were living in the small city of Canakkale, Turkey, where our house was located just next to the beach. During the nights, I would sit at the beach and look at the sky, more and more fascinated by its mystery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the same time, I was making electronic circuits, fixing friends&rsquo; Walkmans (yes, there were Walkmans at the time!) etc., but it was after the movie &ldquo;Contact&rdquo; (1997), which helped me draw a real path to space research.

In Turkey, there is no direct path to work professionally in space research. However, the closest I could find was the Astronomy and Space Sciences program at the University of Ankara. Following graduation, I moved to the U.K. to improve my English and a year later, I started at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands for a Master&rsquo;s in astronomy. Groningen hosts part of the Dutch Space Agency (SRON), and that was where I first came into contact with the HIFI instrument, which is one of the Herschel Space Observatory&rsquo;s three instruments. At that time, the engineers were building HIFI one level below my student office and I was always fascinated by the fact that it would go to space one day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the time, I never thought that this instrument would change my life. After completing my master&rsquo;s, I was accepted to the Leiden Observatory PhD program in molecular astrophysics. There, I worked on data from Herschel's HIFI instrument and a number of ground-based radio/sub-millimeter telescopes. We discovered that there were massive water outflows in the forming stars but could not find oxygen molecules during the formation of a star. We&rsquo;re hoping to find the answer to questions like, why do we have a lot of water and oxygen on Earth? Are they remainders from the formation of the Solar System? After the PhD, I came to JPL in September 2013 for a two-year postdoctoral position. Afterwards, I started at the Spectrum Engineering Group of Communication Architectures and Research Section to work on deep space telecommunications spectrum.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I was mostly self-motivated and turned to books in my early years, especially Carl Sagan&rsquo;s &ldquo;Contact.&rdquo; My PhD advisers Ewine van Dishoeck and Lars Kristensen also really helped me grow professionally.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What does your job entail?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My passion for radio telescopes and big dishes brought me to the deep space telecommunications part of the space program. According to the definition of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), a space probe located further than 2 million km away from the Earth, is called a deep space mission. Deep space missions use special frequency bands to communicate that are allocated and protected by the ITU internationally so that nobody else can use them. Our job is to allocate new frequencies to any new deep space missions that are to be launched by any country so that any possibility of interference is prevented and everybody can happily talk to their missions and not lose any data. We also protect our deep space antennas located in California, Madrid and Canberra from interference from any other nearby ground station antennas. Apart from that, I continue to do astrophysics research, where I am working to understand the formation of stars.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment in your career.</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>When the Herschel Space Observatory reached the L2 point in 2009 and started early performance verification observations. During the first year of my PhD, I was selected as one of the interns assigned to the HIFI Instrument Control Center in Groningen. The most amazing thing was to see and work with that very first Herschel data, where hundreds of people worked hard for more than 30 years to make this dream come true.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What are you looking forward to in your career?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Since childhood, I have always wanted to work on challenging space projects and have even wanted to build a spaceship factory so that I could take people to Mars. I&rsquo;ve noticed it&rsquo;s not easy! So I&rsquo;ll keep on working being a part of the deep space missions, helping answer old questions and ask new questions. That&rsquo;s how science works and how humans advance.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice you you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Three things: Focus on your target, take risks, and never give up. Even during high school I knew that I would work in a space program one day. You only have one life and if you don&rsquo;t have a clear goal, you will end up somewhere you might not like for quite a long time. Think big and have big dreams. You may not reach all of your dreams, but if you don&rsquo;t dream big at all, it is guaranteed that you will not reach anything. Get out of your comfort zone and take risks. Then be flexible. As long as you have a clear final goal, you can alter your plan accordingly, but never give up.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I love spending my time inspiring young people to study STEM. I use social media, especially Twitter, to reach people and talk about astronomy, space and technology. I also do outreach for secondary, high school and university students about space research.</p>\r\n",

I remember we were traveling at night and that we could either take a rather straightforward highway route, or a road \"less traveled.\" My dad decided on the later (I was miffed about his decision; I was tired and the night seemed endless on that road). In the car, my mind wandered until suddenly, and abruptly, the car stopped. My mother and father pulled me and my siblings all out of the car, turned off the car headlights and directed us all to look upward at the most incredible sky! It was filled with the brightest and highest density of stars I had ever seen, and perhaps will ever see! That experience took me off this planet, and forever expanded my world. Even though, I had looked skyward many a time before that night, this marks my first true experience of being in awe of the heavens.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>How did you end up working in the space program? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I first became interested in space science -- and planetary science in particular -- while chatting with some Ph.D. students and postdocs who were sharing with me their excitement about NASA's upcoming Magellan mission to Venus. These students were working with a colleague of mine (Roger Phillips) at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They were explaining to me (from a geophysical perspective) the rheological model of Venus' crust or lithosphere (strong, weak, strong). They cited that some researchers thought (from a geological perspective) that the equatorial region on Venus was similar to Earth's mid-Atlantic ridge; forming a major divergent plate boundary. This was based on the topography of the region. As a structural geologist interested in global-scale tectonics (and to date, \"Earth-bound\"), yet acutely aware of the role in of rheology in tectonic processes, the two views the students presented seemed contradictory to me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You see, <i>if</i> we had a planet with a continental crust-like rheology and were able to pull it apart, we should not get a mid-ocean spreading center. We should instead get continental extensional terrain similar to that in western North America.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Therefore, it seemed to me that one of the views was likely incorrect, and perhaps both views were flawed. I shared my skepticism with the students and soon after I was talking at greater length with Roger Phillips. That wonderful puzzle piqued my interest in Earth's sister planet -- I needed to know more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Roger received the first Magellan images my interest in Venus exploded. One of the first images I saw of Venus was a region in the northern hemisphere: Itzpapalotl Tessera. Itzpapalotl Tessera looked to me then (it still does) like a fantastic example of huge regional-scale shear zone fabrics marked by S and C fabrics, a distinctive and elegant microstructural fabric that develops in rocks in ductile shear zones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With that one image Venus had my heart and my mind. I was bitten -- or was it smitten -- I think it was love at first sight. I realized then, and even more so now, that perhaps one of the best ways to learn about the dynamics and evolution of our own precious planet was to study the other planets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I went on to write a research proposal to the NASA Venus Data Analysis Program, which was selected for funding -- and I was off on a wonderful ride to a new planet with structural and tectonic adventures.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A number of folks have inspired me -- more than I can recall, but here's a small sampling:<br />\r\n*Fourth grade teacher, Ms. Bug (truly!) providing me with the opportunity to play with clay, which remains a passion<br />\r\n*5th grade science teacher, Mr. Maple<br />\r\n*High school physics teacher, Doc Bauer<br />\r\n*College professors, Eiler Hendrickson and Lynn Tennyson<br />\r\n*My Master of Science advisor, Don Hyndman<br />\r\n*Field geologist extraordinaire, Dirk Templeman-Kluit<br />\r\n*Structural geologists extraordinaire, Pierre Choukroune and Win Means<br />\r\n*Ph.D. advisor, Gary Ernst<br />\r\n*Colleague, Roger Phillips<br />\r\n*And, perhaps most of all, a passel of students and kids that question things!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is a Professor? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A professor is someone who gets to learn constantly. They teach, they research, they puzzle, they propose, they are wrong, they discover, and, hopefully, they are an advocate for students and for the processes of learning and discovery.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career. </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I love to learn, and I love to help others learn. Discovering something myself, and watching another person discover a concept (even if others are already aware of the concept) puts a smile on my face I just can't wipe off.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Roger Phillips and I shared an incredible \"moment\" when we put together aspects of Venus' geology. We made connections between the core-mantle boundary, the large-scale surface features and evolution through time. We were able to construct a sort of whole-planet paradigm (Science 1998). Since then, our new detailed (but global!) geologic mapping has shown some aspects of the global hypothesis to be quite wrong -- while other aspects of the hypothesis \"survive and evolve,\" with new major pieces of the puzzle falling into place ... but for how long?</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My advice is two-fold and seemingly contradictory:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One, follow your heart. And two, be flexible and ready to jump into opportunities, even if at first blush the particular opportunity might not be your first choice. Once in the job, don't look back. Don't question what you should have done. Instead, make the most of the opportunities that are open to you. I like to view an opportunity the same way a little kid would view a candy shop: be excited and anticipate that good things are in store for you. Explore the various different directions in which you could go, but finally, honestly put \"your all\" into the job, and work as hard as you can.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, in looking for first jobs, look quite broadly and do not rule out what you think you might not like to do. Perhaps it's my ignorance, but I have found that in so many opportunities there was so much more richness than I ever could have expected from reading the job description. I hope that your ride is as wonderful as mine has been.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Canoeing, kayaking, biking, Nordic skiing, rollerblading, walking with friends -- not all at the same time or even in the same season. I do enjoy taking walks in the woods, along the edges of rushing creeks and along the majestic Lake Superior. I also love to travel, although I haven't traveled near as much as I would like to. I like to spend time in my natural gardens, where I am awed day after day by the simple beauty of botany and bugs. I am an avid potter: I get to play with rheology, metamorphism and fire.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Follow your passion and open your mind; there is more to discover than you can possibly imagine. Do not be concerned with being right, embrace being wrong, and appreciate how that leads you to further discovery. You can only learn what you don't know, so don't hide what you don't know -- question, question, question. And never forget that nature is more incredible than what we could ever make up. Oh, and revisit your assumptions daily ... your view of them just might change.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><b>Read More: </b><br />\r\n*<a href='http://womeninplanetaryscience.wordpress.com/2010/12/30/vicki-hansen-celebrating-research-and-inquiry-and-respect-for-different-ideas/' target='_blank'>Interview on Vicki Hansen by the Women in Planetary Science Website</a><br />\r\n*<a href='http://www.d.umn.edu/geology/research/planetaryLab/index.html' target='_blank'>Planetary Processes Laboratory</a><br />\r\n*<a href='http://www.d.umn.edu/geology/research/planetaryLab/publications.html' target='_blank'>Publications by Vicki Hansen</a><br />\r\n*<a href='http://www.d.umn.edu/geology/people/fsbios/hansen.html' target='_blank'>Vicki Hansen's UMD Faculty Profile</a><br />\r\n*<a href='http://vcs.jpl.nasa.gov/hansen_vicki.html' target='_blank'>Vicki's Venus Colloquium Series Presentations</a></p>\r\n",

I've spent the most time living in Colorado and Arizona, both of which I really like -- Colorado for the mountains and pine forests, and Arizona for the beautiful desert.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Describe the first time you made a personal connection with outer space.</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I think there were two things that intrigued me. <a href='Person:SaganC' target='_blank'>Carl Sagan</a>'s \"Cosmos\" was a big draw to planetary science and astronomy, as it was for many people. The other connection was through my mother's friends, Ed and Alice Stone. Dr. Stone is the project scientist for the Voyager mission, and when I was growing up the Voyagers were on their Grand Tour. The Stones sent us <a href='multimedia/download-detail.cfm?DL_ID=262' target='_blank'>NASA lithographs</a> of the different outer planets and their moons. I recall just being entranced by those images.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><blockquote>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin clearfix'></div>\n<div class='quote'>\n\"... I think this quote from [Carl Sagan]</span><br />\r\n<span>describes what inspires me most about</span><br />\r\n<span>what I do: 'Somewhere, something</span><br />\r\n<span>incredible is waiting to be known.'\"\n</div>\n<footer>\n<cite>- Vicky Hamilton</cite>\n</footer>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin'></div>\n</blockquote></span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>How did you end up working in the space program?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Choosing planetary geology was a very late decision for me, but it's one that's worked out really well and I love it. I was always intrigued by space science as a child, but I never really thought about a career in science because I was better at -- and more comfortable with -- English, social studies and those types of subjects. I didn't find science until I was a junior at Occidental College: I took a geology class to fulfill a science requirement and I enjoyed it a lot. The teachers there told me that I was good at geology and suggested I take another geology class. Ultimately, I ended up majoring in geology.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLater, I was looking for something to do one summer, so I applied for and received a Planetary Geology and Geophysics Undergraduate Research Program (PGGUR) internship at the <a href='http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/' target='_blank'>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</a> (JPL). That summer I spent eight weeks working with the Magellan team. I was involved in mapping <a href='PLANET:Venus' target='_blank'>Venus</a> radar images, looking at volcano-tectonic features and trying to understand them. I was working with space flight data, and peripherally around people and meetings having to do with ongoing space flight operations from day one. Within that first week I realized that working with the Magellan data was the coolest thing I had ever done. I remember thinking \"I'm one of the first dozen people on the planet to see these images of Venus. At the end of the eight weeks, I asked, \"Can I stay?\"<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThen I was looking into graduate school. I was very fortunate in that I had people around me at JPL who I could go to for advice. They were really good about giving me the pros and cons of all the different places and potential advisors. In the end, I felt like Arizona State (ASU) was the right fit for me. It turned out to be a great experience.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAt ASU, I worked with Phil Christensen and I was supposed to work on the Mars Observer mission's Thermal Emission Spectrometer. Unfortunately, Mars Observer failed to go into orbit just a few weeks after I arrived at ASU. So, instead, my dissertation was based largely on laboratory spectroscopy. Being able to do all that lab work for the Ph.D. set me up really well for my post-doc: working with Mars Odyssey's Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS) instrument's dataset. (THEMIS is an imaging spectrometer.)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI am now a researcher at the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) and in addition to being a participating scientist on the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) mission; I'm the deputy instrument scientist for a thermal infrared instrument on the future New Frontiers mission: OSIRIS-REx. OSIRIS-REx will collect samples from an <a href='PLANET:Asteroids' target='_blank'>asteroid</a> and return them to <a href='PLANET:Earth' target='_blank'>Earth</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is a Planetary Geologist?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It's really just what it sounds like -- a geologist who studies planets (including Earth) and small bodies (like asteroids and <a href='PLANET:Comets' target='_blank'>comets</a>), and who works on trying to understand their formation and geologic history. I'm particularly interested in the mineralogy and igneous processes/histories of planetary bodies. I started out studying volcano-tectonic features on Venus. Nowadays, my studies are primarily centered on <a href='PLANET:Mars' target='_blank'>Mars</a>, although new directions include asteroid and <a href='PLANET:Meteors' target='_blank'>meteorite</a> compositional studies.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe main focus of my research is using the spectral features of minerals and rocks in the visible, near infrared and thermal infrared portions of the electromagnetic spectrum to identify and/or characterize the rocks and minerals on planetary surfaces. These data are useful because we can obtain them without being in contact with the planetary surface; we do this via remote sensing (the collection of data from instruments carried by aircraft or spacecraft). I'm also interested in how the compositions of rocks relates to their particle size on the surface and the processes that chemically and mechanically weather rocks.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career.</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I've had many great days when I felt like I'd made a scientific breakthrough, but usually science evolves over time rather than bursting out in a single \"eureka\" moment.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI have to say that some of my favorite moments have been spacecraft launches and landings. I've been fortunate to watch two missions to Mars launch from Cape Canaveral in Florida (Mars Global Surveyor and 2001 Mars Odyssey). There is no experience quite like a spacecraft launch. It's a tremendously emotional feeling of simultaneous exhilaration and sheer terror, compounded by the roar of rocket engines, which you can literally feel in your chest, even from several miles away. It's a great experience!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCertainly the landing of the Mars Science Laboratory rover Curiosity was also a favorite moment; very much like a launch: intense feelings of simultaneous excitement and fear.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I've been fortunate to work with many people who've inspired me with their drive, passion and love of planetary science. However, Ellen Stofan and <a href='Person:ChristensenP' target='_blank'>Phil Christensen</a> have probably been the greatest inspirations to me.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlthough I never had the opportunity to meet Carl Sagan, I think this quote from him describes what inspires me most about what I do: \"Somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Ask yourself what is it that you really like about what you're doing and what it is you don't like about it, and then try to find a position that enables you to do the parts you like. It's okay if you end up deciding, \"I don't want to be a researcher. I don't want to have to write proposals. I don't want to have to write papers.\" That's okay. I think there's a stigma associated with either not finishing [a Ph.D.] or with finishing and then leaving academia, and that's unfortunate.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlso, talk to people and find out what options are out there. It's common for many people to become professors at big universities, but there are options to work at places like the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), the Applied Physics Laboratory (APL), <a href='http://www.nasa.gov/centers/marshall/home/index.html' target='_blank'>Marshall Spaceflight Center (MSFC)</a> or a research institute ... there's a lot of places where you can be a scientist without having to be at a university if you're not interested in teaching.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOr, if you are interested in teaching, but maybe don't want to be at a big research university, there are lots of community colleges that would love to have people who are doing some active research on the side.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBe open to options; there's no one pathway that's right for everybody.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I relax by getting outdoors. I especially enjoy going hiking (and snowshoeing, in winter) in the Rocky Mountains -- I love the smell of a pine forest. I also enjoy photography, particularly landscapes (goes great with hiking) and I'm oddly drawn to extreme close-ups of wildflowers. Recently I've taken up archery, which requires tremendous focus -- there's no room in my head for stress when I'm target shooting.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, there's all kinds of advice one could give any student, but mine would just be to find what interests you and pursue it; life's too short to have a career you don't love. If you go to work in the morning and you're looking forward to it because you're going to do something fun, then you've gotten it right.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>This profile has been adapted in part from an original interview conducted by Susan Niebur for the \"Women in Planetary Science\" website.

I have been working for NASA ever since.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin clearfix'></div>\n<div class='quote'>\n\"Persistence is required because of the endless obstacles that must be overcome to succeed.\"\n</div>\n<footer>\n<cite>- Bill Borucki</cite>\n</footer>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin'></div>\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is a \"Science Principal Investigator\" for the Kepler Mission?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In the early 1980's I published a paper describing how we could detect exoplanets (planets in other solar systems) using photometry. People pooh-poohed the idea. They said that there was no technique for making these kinds of observations. But now Kepler (for which I am the Principal Investigator) is orbiting in space and making observations; observations that contribute to our understanding of how planetary systems form and evolve from the gas and dust disks that give rise to both the stars and their planets. The data from Kepler will have a major impact, especially if we find lots of planets like Earth orbiting in the habitable zones of their stars. Then we'll know it's likely that we aren't alone, and that someday we might be able to join other intelligent life in the Universe.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career. </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>6 March 2009 is a favorite day for me. This is the day when my family and I watched the launch of the Kepler mission. I'd been working on this idea for twenty-five years, so my kids and grandkids have heard about it since they were born. They were delighted to be at the launch, which was magnificent. The solid rockets looked like sparklers as they fell away from the rocket; it was like the spirit of all the team was being launched into space after dedicating so much time and effort to get it into orbit.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Ray Bradbury and his wonderful stories have inspired me greatly in my life.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Grow a thick skin and be persistent. Why? A thick skin is needed to handle all the criticism of what you are trying to do and how you are doing it. Persistence is required because of the endless obstacles that must be overcome to succeed.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun? </b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I like to hike to remote areas to search for mineral specimens. One of my favorite spots for hiking is Pinnacles National Monument. And the mountains of Colorado, Montana and Utah are great for mineral hunting.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Don't do it unless you are willing to put in an enormous amount of time and effort.

      "body": "<p>Oceanographer and climatologist Bill Patzert retired after almost 35 years at the forefront of studying the ocean from space and communicating Earth science to the American public.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He came to NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory after earning a master's and doctorate in oceanography from the University of Hawaii and was there at the start of serious studies of El Nino. Bill helped pitch a new program centered on doing oceanography from space to NASA&mdash;which turned into the Topex/Poseidon mission that measured the surface height of the ocean, providing valuable data about our changing planet. The climate data record begun by Topex/Poseidon now extends more than a quarter century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Read on as Bill talks about his love for the ocean, how El Ni&ntilde;o became so famous, and how he surfed the oceans of Hawaii for seven years.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Where are you from?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I was born on a balmy New York City day. The day was clear and unseasonably warm with breezy northwesterly winds between 5 and 30 mph. A good beginning! Actually, I mostly grew up in Gary, Indiana, on the shores of Lake Michigan (a smallish ocean) surrounded by great Pleistocene sand dunes. Meteorologically, we had blizzards, sweltering summers and even tornadoes.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What first sparked your interest in space?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My dad was a sea captain and taught me celestial navigation, shooting the stars and the Sun with a sextant. At night he would point out the North Star and the many constellations and tell me about the mythology of each. This was heady stuff and fascinating for a budding geek. For my generation, Sputnik was huge. We became the first space-nut generation. Sputnik and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's (JPL) Explorer gave many of my classmates and me the \"space bug.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=''>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin clearfix'></div>\n<div class='quote'>\nOur goal is to better understand the great oceanographic and atmospheric processes well enough to predict what our future will be and to use this knowledge to plan for a sensible future to protect Earth.\n</div>\n<footer>\n<cite>- William Patzert</cite>\n</footer>\n<div class='gradient_line_extra_margin'></div>\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>On college majors and surfing dreams:</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>At Purdue University in Indiana, I doubled majored in math and physics and double minored in geology and American literature. Purdue was far from an ocean. When it came time for graduate school, I was ready for a change&mdash;what I really wanted to do was go to Hawaii and become a big-wave surfer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I spent seven years in Hawaii, surfing the waves all around Oahu. But in spite of my wayward ways and as fate would have it, my mentor there was one of the early researchers in large-scale climate research, as well as El Ni<span>&ntilde;</span>o. After graduate school, I headed for California.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Tell us about your career path:</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My training is in oceanography and meteorology. At the start of my career, the vast oceans and the global atmosphere were poorly sampled. For the first decade of my career, I was a sea-going scientist. I saw much of the world and had great adventures. In the early 1980's, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) was flying satellites that were revolutionizing weather forecasting, and NASA was planning for a suite of ocean-observing spacecraft. Taking a gamble in 1983, I hung up my sea boots and cast my future and meager fortune with NASA and JPL. That gamble has been wildly successful. The Poseidon, Jason-1, and Jason-2 ocean satellites have been flying for almost 18 years. These height-measuring observatories have revolutionized oceanography and climate research. To put it simply, I took a big risk and have had a fantastic career. For me, TOPEX/Poseidon has been my career maker.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='column-width image_module' style=''>\n<figure class='inline_figure'>\n<img alt='Bill Patzert' src='/internal_resources/698'>\n<figcaption>\nBill received the Freedom of Information Award at the Radio TV News Association's Golden Mike Awards on Jan. 27, 2018 in Los Angeles. \n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Many men and women have inspired me. My parents were supportive and stimulating. They loved ideas, education and the natural world. Many of my mentors and professors were superb. And, reading Rachel Carson's \"The Sea Around Us\" opened new worlds to me. I also had the good fortune to spend a week with the late Arthur C. Clark at his home in Sri Lanka. Wow, what a great guy! He encouraged me to be fearless and let my imagination soar. And every day my colleagues, fellow surfers, friends and good books keep me pumped up. I also enjoy the Los Angeles and New York Times; they are more interesting to me than Twitter.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What is a Research Scientist?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>At NASA and JPL, research scientists work with engineers to design and fly science observatories in space to better understand Earth, our Solar System, and deep space. Is that cool or what? Lately, our group has been studying the global rise of the sea level, the great natural climate cycles like El Nino and La Nina, the shrinking of the polar ice caps, and many other ocean processes that impact world civilization. Our goal is to better understand the great oceanographic and atmospheric processes well enough to predict what our future will be and to use this knowledge to plan for a sensible future to protect Earth.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about the night you witnessed TOPEX/Poseidon's launch.</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>On the beautiful evening of August 10, 1982, the TOPEX/Poseidon oceanographic satellite was launched from the Guiana Space Center in Kourou, French Guiana. NASA and CNES (the French Space Agency) had labored for a decade to design, fund and build this <i>beautiful bird.</i> When the sun was setting, the rockets fired, and we were all on pins and needles. Wow, there was a lot of tension and excitement that evening. High anxiety, elation and fantastic celebration lasted until daylight. I was privileged to play a small role and reap a great career. For me, it was even better than surfing and dropping into my first monster wave and surviving. If you ask me, 18 years later I can say, without reservation, that TOPEX/Poseidon has been the most successful ocean experiment of all time!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>How did El Ni</b><span>&ntilde;</span><b>o become so famous?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>From the beginning of my career at JPL, we went from electric typewriters, to desktop computing, to the internet. We launched Topex/Poseidon, and from the start of the mission it was wildly successful. After 25 years of monitoring the global oceans, it has revolutionized oceanography and climate science. One of the key climate measurements is sea level. Ninety-five percent of the heat from global warming is captured in the ocean. So the unequivocal proof of global warming is sea-level rise. We measured it, and it's now an unequivocal scientific fact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All these things came together: the tech revolution, internet, satellites that could monitor essentially what was historically an inaccessible global ocean. Then the 1997-98 El Ni<span>&ntilde;</span>o hit, just as all these things were peaking. We were riding a tsunami of many factors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following the El Ni<span>&ntilde;</span>o of 1997-98, the equatorial Pacific shifted to a cooler pattern, La Ni<span>&ntilde;</span>a, that often has the flip impacts of El Ni<span>&ntilde;</span>o. So, my research switched to understanding the relationship between the warm El Ni<span>&ntilde;</span>o to his cooler sibling, La Ni<span>&ntilde;</span>a.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The satellite data revealed even larger and longer-lasting patterns that influence the frequency and intensity of these two phenomenon. One of those patterns is the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a slow-moving variation of temperatures between the western and eastern sections of the Pacific. In 1998, the western portion was becoming warmer than the eastern portion, leading me to conclude that in the long term, an El Ni<span>&ntilde;</span>o-repellant pattern was forming that would favor drought in Southern California for many years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now we have 25+ years of continuous data, with Topex/Poseidon and Jasons 1 through 3, and the next satellite in the series, Sentinel 6, in the queue. And remarkable things happened, not just El Ni<span>&ntilde;</span>o. The measurements were so well done, so precise, that we actually measured global sea-level rise - which now is about 3 millimeters per year. So over the last two and a half decades, the rise in sea level has been almost three and a half inches.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What has changed for the better at JPL since you started here?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the things that has changed the most about JPL during my career is that it's more diverse. JPL looks a lot more like California than when I was hired&mdash;more women, more ethnic diversity. JPL is getting smarter and better. It looks a lot like the future of America. And it's a good thing.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, hard work, a good education and focus are important. But real success requires passion. You have to love what you do. Choose your career with your heart, not your head. And make it fun!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>When I was 30, fun consisted of surfing and blasting my eardrums with the Beach Boys. And, of course, reading good books. I'm a mystery junkie. Mysteries are addictive! Good historical novels are a treat too. Now, even though I am no longer 30, I still have fun. I collect art of all types... my tastes are eclectic. I have Mexican folk art, Japanese prints, Persian rugs and my prize collection, Hawaiian surf shirts. For exercise, I do some biking, romantic walks on the beach, and have good intentions of doing more. A recent knee replacement slowed me down, but that's no excuse. In L.A., you can turn almost anything into fun. I love the cultural mix of people, the proximity to the mountains and to the sea and the great food.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><b>Read More</b><br />\r\n*<a href='http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hurricanes/bios/patzert_bio.html' target='_blank'>NASA Hurricane Page</a><br />\r\n*<a href='http://science.jpl.nasa.gov/people/Patzert/' target='_blank'>William Patzert's JPL Science Divison Bio</a></p>\r\n",

I applied, got accepted and called NASA right away! True to their word, they supported me by hiring me as a full-time civil servant even though I only worked half-time, and they paid my tuition at Stanford for the next two years. After completing my master's degree in aeronautics and astronautics I decided to change fields and become an astrophysicist, because my work at NASA Ames had been in that area the entire time I was at Stanford. Once again, NASA enabled me to complete an advanced degree by supporting me as I went to the University of California at Santa Cruz for my Ph.D. in Astronomy and Astrophysics. I worked at Ames throughout my Ph.D. program, and some of my thesis data came from flights I had on the Kuiper Airborne Observatory out of Moffett Field.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Who inspired you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My sister is ten years older than I am and has her Ph.D. in statistics. She believed in me and she inspired me by example, while fostering in me the belief that I had what I needed to make my dreams come true. My thesis is actually dedicated to her. As a role model, I learned from her to stay in school and just keep learning -- none of it will go to waste. The combination of my background in aeronautics and astronomy -- two fields I would not have thought had a lot in common -- came together for me aboard the Kuiper Airborne Observatory (KAO). (Now retired, the KAO was a C-141 cargo plane with a ~1 m telescope). I plan to submit observing proposals to the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) as well, which is the next generation airborne astronomy platform-- a Boeing 747 with a ~3 m telescope).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What does the Director of the NASA Lunar Science Institute do?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As the director of the NASA Lunar Science Institute, I oversee about 200 researchers across the U.S. and manage a 13 million dollar budget per year. Currently, our seven domestic teams are joined by seven international partners, and we are all pursuing the latest discoveries in lunar science. The seven domestic teams competed to become a part of the institute, and new teams compete to be a part of the institute every four or five years. Ours is a virtual institute, which means that the small staff located at NASA Ames Research Center uses technology to communicate with and join together the U.S. teams, the international partners and students interested in lunar science around the world. In addition to our \"virtual\" meetings, we hold a three day Lunar Science Forum each summer at NASA Ames Research Center. Over 600 people attended in 2011.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Tell us about a favorite moment so far in your career.</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The first one that comes to mind is the moment I realized that the data I had been working on in my office down the hall matched the data I was seeing presented during a weekly lunchtime seminar. The very distant interstellar dust that I had been studying showed remarkable similarities to the organic component of a meteorite found in Australia. I suddenly knew that the similarity could have far reaching implications because these were signatures of organic matter that came from two very different parts of the cosmos. That was an \"Aha\" moment for me, and my curiosity of how life started on this planet was lifted to new heights. My love of meteorites was born on that day, and I have studied these bits of extraterrestrial material ever since. I am fascinated by the idea that some of the basic building blocks of life on Earth may have come from asteroids and comets. If it happened here, it probably happened elsewhere.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What advice would you give to someone who wants to take the same career path as you?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If you truly love NASA as I do, you will be compelled to do whatever it takes to get here. This agency will always need people who put the goals of exploring space above their own desire for personal recognition. When people align their talents with their heart's desires, there is no limit to what they can accomplish.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>What do you do for fun?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I enjoy my family tremendously. I am happily married to another astronomer, and we have combined our families to join together five (now grown) children who support each other and are true friends. I also raise Golden Retriever puppies, scuba dive in warm oceans whenever I can, and seem to be writing a never-ending mystery novel.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>If you were talking to a student interested in science and math or engineering, what advice would you give them?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Work hard, study hard and stay true to your dreams. Build an extraordinary life for yourself, but build one that stands on a firm foundation of education. There is nothing \"fluffy\" about a Ph.D. in a tough subject. If you have mastered that, you will always know you have what it takes to succeed, no matter what you decide to pursue. Do not look for a job. Design a career that will feed your soul!</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><b>Read More:</b><br />\r\n*<a href='http://lunarscience.nasa.gov/?profile=yvonne-pendleton' target='_blank'>Yvonne's Lunar Science Institute's Profile</a></p>\r\n",
